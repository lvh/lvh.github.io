<p><a href="https://regexcrossword.com/">Regex Crossword</a> is a puzzle game to help you
practice regular expressions. I wrote a program to solve them. You can find it
on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/lvh/regex-crossword"><code>lvh/regex-crossword</code></a>.
This blog post walks you through how I wrote it using logic programming.</p>
<p>To me this game feels more like Sudoku than a crossword. When you solve a
crossword, you start by filling out the words you're certain of and use those
answers as hints for the rest. Backtracking is relatively rare. In a sudoku, you
might start by filling out a handful of certain boxes, but in most puzzles you
quickly need to backtrack. That distinction shapes how I think of solving it:
searching and backtracking is a natural fit for logic programming.</p>
<p>Logic programming is a niche technology, but in its sweet spot it's miraculous.
I'll introduce the concept to help you recognize what sorts of problems it's
good at. Worst case, you'll enjoy a cool hack. Best case you'll get the
satisfaction of writing a beautiful solution to a problem some time in the
future.</p>
<p>My programming language of choice is Clojure, and Clojure has
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic"><code>clojure/core.logic</code></a>, a logic programming library. Because logic
programming is such a specialized tool, it's more useful to have libraries that
let you "drop in to" logic programming than to do everything in a full-blown
logic programming language.</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>It would not be a bad idea to read <a href="https://regexcrossword.com/howtoplay">the instructions for Regex
Crossword</a>. I'll also assume you have seen some basic regular
expressions. Hopefully the Clojure will be piecemeal enough you can
just follow along, but reading a tutorial wouldn't hurt.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the first beginner puzzle:</p>
<figure><img src="../../img/regex-crossword/beginner1.png" alt="the first regex crossword level in the Beginner set"><figcaption>The first level in the Beginner set, <a href="https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner/puzzles/1">"Beatles"</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Each regex part applies to some number of unknowns (empty boxes). The first row
regex <code>HE|LL|O+</code> applies to the unknowns of the first row. The first column
regex <code>[^SPEAK]+</code> applies to the unknowns of the first column. Both constrain
the top left unknown: we're counting on our logic programming engine at being
convenient for expressing that "cascading" of constraints.</p>
<p>An unknown is just a logic variable in constraint logic programming. For brevity
we'll call them "lvars" (<em>[ell vars]</em>).</p>
<p>Rows, columns (and in later puzzles hexagon lines) are all just layout.
Fundamentally it's all just a regex applying to some lvars.</p>
<h2>Breaking down regular expressions</h2>
<p>Most regular expressions have structure, like <code>(AB|CD)XY</code>. We'll solve this
problem recursively: if <code>(AB|CD)XY</code> matches lvars <code>p, q, r, s</code>, then presumably
<code>pq</code> must match <code>AB|CD</code> and <code>rs</code> must match <code>XY</code>.</p>
<p>(There are some counterexamples to the idea that we can solve the entire problem
recursively! For example, backrefs within a regex would require a second pass,
and backrefs across regular expressions would require another top-level pass.
We'll deal with those later. There are ties to language theory here, but that's
a story for another day.)</p>
<p>We'll parse the regular expression into a data structure that's easier to
handle. Fortunately, there's a piece of code out there that knows how to
generate strings matching a given regex, which has a parser we can reuse. That
parser is designed for Java's regular expression syntax. It's not quite
identical to that of JavaScript, but we're hoping that the puzzles avoid those
tricky edge cases for now.</p>
<p>To parse, we use <code>[com.gfredericks.test.chuck.regexes :as cre]</code>.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">cre/parse</span> <span class="s">"HE|LL|O+"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">;; =&gt; (read: produces)</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:alternation</span>,
 <span class="ss">:elements</span>
 <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>,
   <span class="ss">:elements</span>
   <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\H</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\E</span><span class="p">})}</span>
  <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>,
   <span class="ss">:elements</span>
   <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\L</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\L</span><span class="p">})}</span>
  <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>,
   <span class="ss">:elements</span>
   <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:repetition</span>,
     <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\O</span><span class="p">}]</span>,
     <span class="ss">:bounds</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">]})})}</span>
</pre>


<p>Progress! It is indeed an alternation (a or b) of a concatenation of H and E, or
L and L, or the letter O one or more times.</p>
<h2>Logic machinery</h2>
<p>The logic programming engine is going to search a tree of possibilities for
solutions that fit your constraints. Logic programming is inherently
declarative: instead of telling the computer how to find the answer, we describe
what the answer looks like.</p>
<p>An lvar that doesn't have a value assigned to it yet (it could still be
anything) is called "fresh". An lvar with a definite value is called "bound".
There is nothing preventing your program from returning fresh variables: that
just means the answer that doesn't rely on what that lvar taking any particular
value (like the <em>x</em> in <em>0x = 0</em>).</p>
<p>In core.logic, a program consists of a series of expressions called <em>goals</em>.
<code>(l/== a b)</code> is a goal to make the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> equal. It does not, by
itself, compare <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> or assign anything to anything. It just expresses the
idea of comparing the two. Logic programming calls this "unification".</p>
<p>As the engine searches the space of possible answers, sometimes <code>a</code> will be
equal to <code>b</code> already, or <code>a</code> will be bound and <code>b</code> will be fresh in which case
<code>b</code> will become bound to whatever <code>a</code> was bound to. Either way, the two
variables can be <em>unified</em> and the goal is said to <em>succeed</em>. But in many parts
of the tree this doesn't work out: <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will already be bound to
incompatible values. In that case, the goal is said to fail. Unification is just
one of many goals, but it's the most important one in most programs including
ours.</p>
<p>Finally, we need a way to actually run the logic programming engine. that's
<code>clojure.core.logic/run</code>'s job. Something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/run</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]</span>            <span class="c1">;; run to find up to one answer with logic vars [q]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/==</span> <span class="nv">q</span> <span class="ss">'fred</span><span class="p">)</span>        <span class="c1">;; where q is unified with 'fred</span>
</pre>


<p>... will return <code>('fred)</code> (the 1-list with the symbol <code>'fred</code> in it) because
there's only one answer for <code>q</code> that makes all the goals (here just one goal)
succeed. <code>run</code> takes the <em>maximum number of answers</em> as a parameter. Since
you're describing what the answer looks like, there might be zero, one, or any
other number of answers. Sometimes the engine will be able to prove there are no
other options (because the search was exhaustive) and it'll return fewer. Some
programs run forever, some so long it might as well be forever. <code>run</code> has a
sibling <code>run*</code> that gets you all the answers. It returns the same result,
because there's only one value for <code>q</code> that makes all goals succeed.</p>
<h2>Character match</h2>
<p>The simplest possible regular expression is just a character, which matches
itself: <code>A</code>. In our parse tree, this is an entry of <code>:type</code> <code>:character</code>. We'll
write a multimethod dispatching on <code>:type</code> to make this work so we can implement
other types later.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmulti </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="ss">:type</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>A character looks like this: <code>{:type :character, :character \L}</code>. We'll use
destructuring to extract the <code>:character</code> key. In general, this multimethod will
take multiple lvars, though incidentally in the case of <code>:character</code> it'll
be just one, so we can destructure it as well.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmethod </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>
  <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:keys</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">character</span><span class="p">]}</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">lvar</span><span class="p">]]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/==</span> <span class="nv">character</span> <span class="nv">lvar</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>


<p>We'll write a test to verify this works.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/deftest</span> <span class="nv">re-&gt;goal-character-test</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/is</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">)</span>
           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/run*</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]</span>
             <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">rcl/re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">])))))</span>
</pre>


<h2>Alternation</h2>
<p>Let's look at a few parse trees for some simple alternations:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">cre/parse</span> <span class="s">"A|B"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">;; =&gt;</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:alternation</span>,
 <span class="ss">:elements</span>
 <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>, <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">})}</span>
  <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>, <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\B</span><span class="p">})})}</span>
</pre>


<p>Here's an example where the options are different length.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">cre/parse</span> <span class="s">"AAA|B"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">;; =&gt;</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:alternation</span>,
 <span class="ss">:elements</span>
 <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>,
   <span class="ss">:elements</span>
   <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">})}</span>
  <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>
   <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\B</span><span class="p">})})}</span>
</pre>


<p>It's also probably a good idea to consider something with more than two alternatives:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">cre/parse</span> <span class="s">"A|B|C"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">;; =&gt;</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:alternation</span>,
 <span class="ss">:elements</span>
 <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>, <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">})}</span>
  <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>, <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\B</span><span class="p">})}</span>
  <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>, <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>, <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\C</span><span class="p">})})}</span>
</pre>


<p>Note the parser will always create concatenations as elements of alternations
even if the element is really just a single character. We can't handle
concatenations yet, so while we generally prefer things that the parser actually
produces, we'll cheat with an alternation of characters first.</p>
<h3>Alternation in logic</h3>
<p>The obvious test to write is:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/deftest</span> <span class="nv">re-&gt;goal-alternation-test</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/is</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sc">\A</span> <span class="sc">\B</span><span class="p">)</span>
           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/run*</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]</span>
             <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">rcl/re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">cre/parse</span> <span class="s">"A|B"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">])))))</span>
</pre>


<p>... but as we saw above, that introduces concatenations. Instead:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/is</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sc">\A</span> <span class="sc">\B</span><span class="p">)</span>
           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/run*</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]</span>
             <span class="c1">;; "A|B" with the internal concatenations removed</span>
             <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">rcl/re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:alternation</span>
                            <span class="ss">:elements</span>
                            <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">}</span>
                             <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\B</span><span class="p">}]}</span>
                           <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]))))</span>

  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/is</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sc">\A</span> <span class="sc">\B</span> <span class="sc">\C</span><span class="p">)</span>
           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/run*</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]</span>
             <span class="c1">;; "A|B|C" with the internal concatenations removed</span>
             <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">rcl/re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:alternation</span>
                            <span class="ss">:elements</span>
                            <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">}</span>
                             <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\B</span><span class="p">}</span>
                             <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\C</span><span class="p">}]}</span>
                           <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]))))</span>
</pre>


<p>We need a way to express disjunction. Like <code>l/and*</code>, there's a <code>l/or*</code>. Once we
have that, alternation is straightforward:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmethod </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="ss">:alternation</span>
  <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:keys</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">elements</span><span class="p">]}</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/or*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="o">#</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="nv">%</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">elements</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre>


<p>This primer is a little unorthodox because we're walking through a problem that
requires rule generation. Most introductory texts make you build up static
rules. Disjunction is usually expressed with the macro <code>l/conde</code>. One difference
is that <code>conde</code> can express a disjunction of conjunctions in one go:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">conde</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">c</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="c1">;; is equivalent to</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">or*</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nf">and*</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">c</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre>


<h2>Concatenation</h2>
<p>We want to be able to solve squares, not just individual letters. The simplest
case is a concatenation of two characters, like <code>AA</code>.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="ss">:character</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">})</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">aa</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span> <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">a</span><span class="p">]})</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/deftest</span> <span class="nv">re-&gt;goal-concatenation-test</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/is</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="sc">\A</span> <span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">))</span>
           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/run*</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">p</span> <span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]</span>
             <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">rcl/re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="nv">aa</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">p</span> <span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">])))))</span>
</pre>


<p>A simple implementation passes this test:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmethod </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>
  <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:keys</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">elements</span><span class="p">]}</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/and*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">for </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">e</span> <span class="nv">elements</span>
                <span class="nv">v</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">]</span>
            <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="nv">e</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">v</span><span class="p">]))))</span>
</pre>


<p>(<code>l/and*</code>is a function that returns a goal that succeeds when all its goals
succeed. We'd use the macro version <code>l/all</code> if we were explicitly writing out
our goals. Because we're generating them, it's easier to use a function.)</p>
<p>We're clearly abusing the fact that we happen to know that the parts are
characters and therefore length 1. But the parts could be repetitions, or an
alternation between concatenations each of length &gt;1.</p>
<h3>Distributing lvars over groups</h3>
<p>Next, we need to find the ways lvars can be distributed over the individual
elements. We know that each lvar represents a square and each square must be
assigned, so we know that the sum of the lengths of the elements must be the
total number of lvars.</p>
<p>We can actually solve this sub-problem using logic programming as well! We'll
use CLP(FD), which means "constraint logic programming over finite domains".</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="c1">;; [clojure.core.logic.fd :as f]</span>

</pre>


<p>As mentioned before, the approach we've taken to this problem is unique because
we're <em>generating</em> rules. Most logic programs have a static structure and
dynamic data, while our data informs the structure itself. We need to know how
many groups there are to know how many lvars to create with <code>fresh</code>. <code>f/eq</code> is
itself a convenience macro that rewrites "normal" Lisp-style equations (like <code>(=
10 (+ x y z))</code>) to a form the logic engine knows how to solve directly.</p>
<p>One way to solve that problem is with macros and <code>eval</code>, but that might impede our
ability to port to e.g. ClojureScript and native-image. Plus, I wanted to learn
more about how the finite domain magic works internally.</p>
<p>The main thing <code>f/eq</code> does here is introduce intermediate variables. The
underlying goal <code>f/+</code> only takes 3 arguments: two summands and a sum result. To
express a sum over many summands you need intermediate "running total" lvars. I
wrote that:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">reduceo</span>
  <span class="s">"Given a binary operator goal, return an n-ary one.</span>

<span class="s">  If the given goal has shape `(⊕ x y z)` meaning `x ⊕ y = z`, `(reduceo ⊕ z</span>
<span class="s">  vars)` computes `z = vars[0] ⊕ vars[1] ⊕ vars[2]...`."</span>
  <span class="c1">;; lower case are input vars (a, b, c, d...)</span>
  <span class="c1">;; upper case are intermediate accumulator lvars ("running totals")</span>
  <span class="c1">;; Ω is the final result</span>

  <span class="c1">;;</span>
  <span class="c1">;; There are two fewer accumulators than there are input lvars. The middle</span>
  <span class="c1">;; equations all use 2 accumulators each: one to carry the previous result and</span>
  <span class="c1">;; one to carry it to the next equation. The first equation uses 2 input vars</span>
  <span class="c1">;; and 1 accumulator, and the last equation uses 1 input var, 1 accumulator</span>
  <span class="c1">;; and the result (which may be an lvar, but it's not _our_ lvar -- and in</span>

</pre>


<p>This lets us define a sum goal and a helper function that runs the logic engine
for us to find all the ways we can sum up to a number, with some bounds:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">sumo</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">partial </span><span class="nv">reduceo</span> <span class="nv">f/+</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">summands</span>

<span class="s">  know. Possible assignments are returned in the same order."</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">total</span> <span class="nv">bounds</span><span class="p">]</span>

                      <span class="nv">lvars</span> <span class="nv">bounds</span><span class="p">)]</span>

</pre>


<p>Finally we need a way to use these weights to partition up a collection:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">partition-by-weights</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">weights</span> <span class="nv">coll</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">loop </span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="nv">weight</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="nv">rest-weights</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="nv">weights</span>
         <span class="nv">coll</span> <span class="nv">coll</span>
         <span class="nv">acc</span> <span class="p">[]]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">some?</span> <span class="nv">weight</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">recur</span>
       <span class="nv">rest-weights</span>
       <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">drop </span><span class="nv">weight</span> <span class="nv">coll</span><span class="p">)</span>
       <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">conj </span><span class="nv">acc</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">take </span><span class="nv">weight</span> <span class="nv">coll</span><span class="p">)))</span>
      <span class="nv">acc</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre>


<p>There's an alternative way to write this using <code>appendo</code>: <code>(l/appendo a b c)</code> is
like <code>append</code> but for lvars. You can create a version that supports multiple
lists (let's call it <code>concato</code>) using the same machinery:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">concato</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">partial </span><span class="nv">reduceo</span> <span class="nv">l/appendo</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>


<p>In a sense <code>concato</code> is more direct: the lists are the lists you want, there's
no <code>partition-by-weights</code> to translate from your numeric answer to the list
partitions you need. With all of these goals in place we can implement
concatenation. We find each possible weight distribution, and for each
distribution, each group must match that set of lvars.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmethod </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="ss">:concatenation</span>
  <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:keys</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">elements</span><span class="p">]}</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">n-vars</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">count </span><span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="nv">n-elems</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">count </span><span class="nv">elements</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="nv">bounds</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="nv">n-vars</span><span class="p">]]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/or*</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">for </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">weights</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">summands</span> <span class="nv">n-vars</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">repeat </span><span class="nv">n-elems</span> <span class="nv">bounds</span><span class="p">))</span>
           <span class="ss">:let</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">lvar-groups</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">partition-by-weights</span> <span class="nv">weights</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">)]]</span>
       <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/and*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="nv">elements</span> <span class="nv">lvar-groups</span><span class="p">))))))</span>
</pre>


<h2>Fixing :character</h2>
<p>What the concatenation problem tells us is that character is broken, too.
Concatenation may attempt to assign 2 lvars to a single character. Right now,
that returns a goal unifying the first lvar with that character: if there were
more, the remaining lvars would simply go unconstrained:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmethod </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>
  <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:keys</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">character</span><span class="p">]}</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">lvar</span><span class="p">]]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/==</span> <span class="nv">character</span> <span class="nv">lvar</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>


<p>We communicate a problem with a failing goal. If some goal fails, the engine
will stop exploring that branch. The always-failing goal <code>l/fail</code> is designed
for this sort of thing. (You can probably guess what its counterpart <code>l/succeed</code>
does.) The amended version looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmethod </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="ss">:character</span>
  <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:keys</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">character</span><span class="p">]}</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">lvar</span> <span class="ss">:as</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">]]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">-&gt; </span><span class="nv">lvars</span> <span class="nb">count </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/==</span> <span class="nv">character</span> <span class="nv">lvar</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nv">l/fail</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>


<p>You could also do this in logic programming so that it's checked at runtime, but
since we're generating our goals ahead of time here and only giving them to the
engine at the end, we can short-circuit here.</p>
<h2>Repetition</h2>

<p>This matches our expectation, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>A{n}</code> means exactly <em>n</em> A's</li>
<li>
<code>A{m,n}</code> means between <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> A's, inclusive</li>
<li>
<code>A{n,}</code> means <code>n</code> or more A's</li>
<li>
<code>A*</code> means 0 or more A's</li>
<li>
<code>A+</code> means 1 or more A's</li>
</ul>
<p>"No bound" is represented by <code>nil</code>. Some numbers are represented as just <code>1</code>,
others as <code>1N</code>. The latter are <code>clojure.lang.BigInts</code>, not longs. The parser
does this so it can support regexes with pathologically large sizes (longer than
a <code>long</code>, a signed 64-bit integer). We can ignore that distinction: both behave
identically for our purposes.</p>
<h3>Implementing repetition</h3>
<p>Repetition has a generalization of the <code>:character</code> behavior we fixed earlier TKTK multiple vars</p>

<h2>Trying to solve a few puzzles</h2>
<p>We've done quite a bit of work but still haven't solved any real puzzles. We'd
like to solve the game's own puzzles, so let's start from its internal
representation. Remember the first puzzle from the beginner set:</p>
<figure><img src="../../img/regex-crossword/beginner1.png" alt="the first regex crossword level in the Beginner set"><figcaption>The first level in the Beginner set, <a href="https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner/puzzles/1">"Beatles"</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Its internal representation looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ jq <span class="s1">'.[1].puzzles[0]'</span> challenges.json
<span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"id"</span>: <span class="s2">"475e811a-da59-4ce8-9b80-3124b33cc041"</span>,
  <span class="s2">"name"</span>: <span class="s2">"Beatles"</span>,
  <span class="s2">"patternsX"</span>: <span class="o">[</span>
    <span class="o">[</span>
      <span class="s2">"[^SPEAK]+"</span>
    <span class="o">]</span>,
    <span class="o">[</span>
      <span class="s2">"EP|IP|EF"</span>
    <span class="o">]</span>
  <span class="o">]</span>,
  <span class="s2">"patternsY"</span>: <span class="o">[</span>
    <span class="o">[</span>
      <span class="s2">"HE|LL|O+"</span>
    <span class="o">]</span>,
    <span class="o">[</span>
      <span class="s2">"[PLEASE]+"</span>
    <span class="o">]</span>
  <span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre>


<p>(We'll turn the keys to kebab-case-keywords so it looks a bit more Clojure-y.)
There's something strange about the sample data: <code>:patterns-x</code> and <code>:patterns-y</code>
are both seqs of seqs of patterns. You may have expected them to be seqs of
patterns directly. This data structure choice isn't obvious until you hit a
later puzzle such as the first level in the "Double Cross" set:</p>
<figure><img src="../../img/regex-crossword/doublecross.png" alt="the first regex crossword level in the Double Cross set"><figcaption>The first level in the Double Cross set, <a href="https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/doublecross/puzzles/1">"Telekinesis"</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>This puzzle is represented internally as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:id</span> <span class="s">"f0f06b00-ec0a-4572-935d-7459e2a13064"</span>
 <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="s">"Telekinesis"</span>
 <span class="ss">:patterns-x</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="s">"[D-HJ-M]"</span> <span class="s">"[^F-KM-Z]"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"[^A-RU-Z]"</span> <span class="s">"[A-KS-V]"</span><span class="p">]]</span>

</pre>


<p>As you can see this just represents different patterns affecting the same row.
Ironically while this is presumably intended to make the puzzle harder, the
extra constraints probably just make the logic engine's life easier. Either way,
solving means we make some lvars for each box, carve them up by rows and
columns, and then apply the regex goals:</p>

<p>We can use this to solve the first tutorial puzzle:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">solve</span>
 <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:id</span> <span class="s">"272901bb-0855-4157-9b45-272935da8c93"</span>

<span class="c1">;; =&gt; (((\A)))</span>
</pre>


<p>Unfortunately, the second one has character classes, so we have to implement
that next.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:id</span> <span class="s">"6915fafc-3323-484d-b801-5daac73ddb56"</span>

 <span class="ss">:patterns-y</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="s">"[BDF]"</span><span class="p">]]}</span>
</pre>


<h2>Character classes</h2>
<p>Let's look at another parse:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">cre/parse</span> <span class="s">"[A]"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">;; =&gt;</span>

       <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:class-union</span>
         <span class="ss">:elements</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="ss">:class-base</span> <span class="ss">:chars</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="sc">\A</span><span class="p">}}]}]}]</span>
     <span class="ss">:brackets?</span> <span class="nv">true</span><span class="p">}]}]}</span>
</pre>


<p>Whoa! This parses to something a lot trickier than you might've guessed. Class
sets (intersections, unions and subtraction) are somewhat obscure set of regex
features with slightly differing support across platforms and slightly different
syntax. They're particularly useful when you have a full Unicode regex engine
and you want to say things like "match characters in this script, but not digits
or punctuation". In Java, Ruby and Python, they are spelled something like
<code>[α&amp;&amp;[β]&amp;&amp;[γ]]</code> where <code>αβγ</code> are all their own class specs.</p>
<p>This is a side-effect of using a parser intended for parsing Java regular
expressions. JavaScript doesn't support these features. Fortunately, they're
pretty easy to implement. As usual, we'll tackle the simple base case first.</p>

<h3>Class union and intersection</h3>

original JavaScript puzzle would never have them, they're trivial to express in
logic, so let's just do them properly:</p>

<h3>Ranges</h3>
<p>You're probably catching on. Implementing ranges uses a bunch of logic machinery
we already use, and just a Clojure description of what a range <em>is</em>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">t/is</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sc">\A</span> <span class="sc">\B</span> <span class="sc">\C</span> <span class="sc">\D</span> <span class="sc">\E</span> <span class="sc">\F</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Because ranges like <code>A-Z0-9</code> are implemented using <code>:class-union</code>, they just
magically work.</p>
<h3>Simple classes</h3>
<p>"Simple classes" are things like <code>\d</code>, <code>\w</code>, <code>\s</code>. You know how to implement
these already.</p>
<h2>Class negation</h2>
<p>Class negation is actually surprisingly tricky! Many logic systems, core.logic
included, focus on positive statements. There is support for disunification
(e.g. this lvar will never be 5) with <code>l/!=</code>. There's also more general support
for negation as a constraint, as used here:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmethod </span><span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="ss">:class-negation</span>
    <span class="p">[{</span><span class="ss">:keys</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">elements</span><span class="p">]}</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/and*</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">for </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">e</span> <span class="nv">elements</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/nafc</span> <span class="nv">re-&gt;goal</span> <span class="nv">e</span> <span class="nv">lvars</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</pre>


<p>Unfortunately nafc is marked as experimental and for good reason. For one, it
only works if the vars are ground. Docstring claims execution will be delayed if
they aren't... but that doesn't appear to be true. See
<a href="https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/LOGIC-172">LOGIC-172</a> for details. This
problem annoyingly surfaced depending on the order clauses were evaluated in
(since that changed if they were ground or not). I was able to get it to work
consistently by adding a hack to make sure the vars are ground, and adding a
test to make sure it would work even if this was the first clause:</p>

<p>A different way to implement this would be to walk this part of the parse tree
manually. Once you find a negation, you look at the rest of the parse tree and
aggregate all the classes it covers. Then, you use plain negation
(disunification), which has no caveats. This is what I ended up implementing; if
you're interested you can read the details <a href="https://github.com/lvh/regex-crossword/blob/fd00aa5f97f285c2bcf4c539144e96d18573f755/src/lvh/regex_crossword/logic.clj#L99">in the implementation</a>.</p>
<h2>Backrefs</h2>
<p>Backreferences are an interesting challenge because so far we've just assumed we
can recurisvely turn the regex parse tree into goals piecemeal, and backrefs
break that assumption: they necessarily depend on a totally different part of
the parse tree. There are two ways to address that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the implementation to produce a data structure instead of logic goals
   directly, and then do something eval-like later to turn the data structure
   into goals</li>
<li>Cheat and introduce side effects to propagate within the tree walk.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first is clearly the "good" answer. It would also enable other improvements,
like tree-level performance optimization. It's also a good chunk of work, and I
had spent enough time on this weekend project already. So, instead, I did the
hacky side-effecty version. This turned out to be tricky to implement not from a
logic perspective (that part is easy) but because the underlying parser I had
forklifted was from a project that didn't support backrefs, and so it didn't
bother to parse them out correctly. You can see how I hacked around that <a href="https://github.com/lvh/regex-crossword/blob/fd00aa5f97f285c2bcf4c539144e96d18573f755/src/lvh/regex_crossword/logic.clj#L126">in the
implementation</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This introduction was a little unorthodox. Most texts focus on introducing
different primitives, have you write small static rules and build up from there.
You'll see <code>conde</code> long before anyone talks to you about <code>or*</code>.
Negation-as-failure, which we used for classes, is exotic and non-relational.
The way we implemented backrefs works but is inelegant. That's all just a
consequence of the problem we solved, not a principled stance on how to use
<code>core.logic</code> let alone teach it. Reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992">The Little Schemer</a> is still a
good idea if you want to learn to write your own programs.</p>
<p>(If you want a logic program where the goals are not fixed in advance, you might
want to just stick to the JVM so there are no restrictions on eval use. I
haven't tried running core.logic on <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/sci">sci</a>.)</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>These are things I thought were neat but didn't make sense in the original text.</p>
<h3>Running programs backwards</h3>
<p>A truly mind-bending feature of relational programs is that they can be ran
"backwards". Usually, you write a program "forwards": it has some inputs and you
expect some outputs. If you write your logic program a particular way, it
doesn't actually know what's an input and what's an output, and so you can give
it an "output" and it will come up with "inputs" that would have led to that
output. This post did not demonstrate that, but it's one of the better hooks
I've found to get people excited about logic programming. I could not give this
talk better than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVDCRlW1f1Y">Will Byrd presenting miniKanren</a>. I won't spoil the
ending, but go watch that talk.</p>
<p>Our program does not work that way. All our "inputs" are rules, all our lvars
are the same kind (unknown boxes), so running it "backwards" doesn't really mean
anything. It could, if our parser and rule generation were also fully
relational. In that case, we could fill out some boxes and our program would
tell us progressively more creative regular expressions that would match them.
Instead of a puzzle solver, we would have written a puzzle creator.</p>
<h3>Palindromes</h3>
<p>Some puzzles have hints that help you solve them. Usually they're thematic cues,
(e.g. "Hamlet") which are hard to tell a logic engine about. Structural cues are
easy. For example, if you think some lines should be palindromes, you can just
add the following constraint:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/all*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">fn </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">vars</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/==</span> <span class="nv">vars</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">reverse </span><span class="nv">vars</span><span class="p">)))</span> <span class="nv">lines</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>


<p>If evaluated at the right time, this should constrain the search tree. It's
tricky to make sure that happens without measurement and fiddling.</p>
<h3>Thematic cues</h3>
<p>If you really wanted to add thematic cues, e.g. "Hamlet", you could grab the
Wikipedia page, use something like TF/IDF to find important words, filter by the
appropriate size, and introduce them as constraints. I don't expect this will
speed anything up much even if you discount the initial step.</p>
<h3>Hexagon shaped puzzles</h3>
<p>I made these work, but didn't hook it up to the solver permanently (mostly
because I lost interest). I like hex grids a lot, but they're not interesting
from a logic perspective so I didn't cover them in this post. You can check out
<a href="https://github.com/lvh/regex-crossword/blob/master/src/lvh/regex_crossword/slices.clj">the implementation</a> but be warned: it's mostly just some tedious bean
counting.</p>
