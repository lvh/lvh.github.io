Craig Costello, Patrick Longa and Michael Naehrig, three cryptographers at
Microsoft Research, recently published a [paper][costello] on supersingular
isogeny Diffie-Hellman. This paper garnered a lot of interest in the security
community and even made it to the front page of Hacker News. Most of the
discussion around it seemed to be how no-one understands isogenies, even
within cryptography-literate communities. This article aims to give you a
high-level understanding of what this cryptosystem is and why it works.

This post assumes that you already know how Diffie-Hellman works in the
abstract, and that you know elliptic curves are a mathematical construct that
you can use to perform Diffie-Hellman operations, just like you can with the
integers *mod p* (that would be "regular" Diffie-Hellman). If that was
gibberish to you and you'd like to know more, check out [Crypto 101][c101], my
free introductory book on cryptography. You don't need a math background to
understand those concepts at a high level. The main difference is that Crypto
101 sticks to production cryptography, while this is still experimental.

It's not surprising that isogeny-based cryptography is so confusing. Up until
recently, it was unambiguously in the realm of research, not even close to
being practically applicable. Its mathematical underpinnings are much more
complex than regular elliptic curves, let alone integers *mod p*. It also
looks superficially similar to elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman, which only adds
to the confusion.

With that, let's begin!

**What is this paper about?**

Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) is one of a handful of
"post-quantum" cryptosystems. Those are cryptosystems that will remain secure
even if the attacker has access to a large quantum computer. This has nothing
to do with quantum cryptography (for example, quantum key distribution)
beyond their shared quantum mechanical underpinning.

**Why should I care about quantum computers?**

General quantum computers are not useful as general-purpose computing devices,
but they can solve some problems much faster than classical
computers. Classical computers can emulate quantum computers, but only with
exponential slowdown. A sufficiently large quantum computer could break most
production cryptography, including cryptosystems based on the difficulty of
factoring large numbers (like RSA), taking discrete logs over the integers
*mod p* (like regular DH), or taking discrete logs over elliptic curves (like
ECDH and ECDSA). To quantify that, consider the following table:

![quantum computer attack cost versus classical][qcost]
[qcost]: /img/post-quantum/quantum-computer-relative-cost.png

In this table, n refers to the modulus size for RSA, and the field size for
ECC. Look at the rightmost column, which represents time taken by the
classical algorithm, and compare it to the "time" columns, which represent how
much a quantum computer would take. As *n* increases, the amount of time the
quantum computer would take stays in the same ballpark, whereas for a
classical computer it increases (almost) exponentially. Therefore, increasing
n is an effective strategy for keeping up with ever-faster classical
computers, but it is ineffective at increasing the run time for a quantum
computer.

**Aah! Why isn't everyone panicking about this?!**

The good news is that these large quantum computers don't exist yet.

If you look at the qubits column, you'll see that these attacks require large
universal quantum computers. The state of the art in those only has a handful
of qubits. In 2011, IBM successfully factored 143 using a 4-qubit quantum
computer. Scaling the number of qubits up is troublesome. In that light,
larger key sizes may prove effective after all; we simply don't know yet how
hard it is to build quantum computers that big.

D-wave, a quantum computing company, has produced computers with 128 and 512
qubits and even >1000 qubits. While there is some discussion if D-waves
provide quantum speedup or are even real quantum computers at all; there is no
discussion that they are not *universal* quantum computers. Specifically, they
only claim to solve one particular problem called quantum annealing. The 1000
qubit D-Wave 2X cannot factor RSA moduli of ~512 bits or solve discrete logs
on curves of ~120 bits.

The systems at risk implement asymmetric encryption, signatures, and
Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. That's no accident: all post-quantum
alternatives are asymmetric algorithms. Post-quantum secure symmetric
cryptography is easier: we can just use bigger key sizes, which are still
small enough to be practical and result in fast primitives. Quantum computers
simply halve the security level, so all we need to do to maintain a 128 bit
security level is to use ciphers with 256 bit keys, like Salsa20.

Quantum computers also have an advantage against SIDH, but both are still
exponential in the field size. The SIDH scheme in the new paper has 192 bits
of security against a classical attacker, but still has 128 bits of security
against a quantum attacker. That's in the same ballpark as most symmetric
cryptography, and better than the 2048-bit RSA certificates that underpin the
security of the Internet.

**What makes this paper special?**

Post-quantum cryptography has been firmly in the realm of academic research
and experiments. This paper makes significant advancements in how practically
applicable SIDH is.

**Being future-proof sounds good. If this makes it practical, why don't we
start using it right now?**

SIDH is a young cryptosystem in a young field, and hasn't had the same level
of scrutiny as some of the other post-quantum cryptosystems, let alone the
"regular" cryptosystems we use daily. Attacks only get better, they never get
worse. It's possible that SIDH is insecure and we just don't know how to break
it yet. It does have a good argument for why quantum algorithms wouldn't be
able to crack it (more on that later), but that's a hypothesis, not a proof.

The new performance figures from this paper are impressive, but this system is
still much slower than the ones we use today. Key generation and key exchange
take a good 50 million cycles or so each. That's about a thousand times slower
than Curve25519, a curve designed about 10 years ago. Key sizes are also much
larger: SIDH public keys are 751 bytes, whereas Curve25519 keys are only 32
bytes. For on-line protocols like HTTPS operating over TCP, that's a
significant cost.

Finally, there are issues with implementing SIDH safely. Systems like
Diffie-Hellman over integers *mod p* are much less complex than elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), let alone SIDH. With ECDH and ECC in general, we've
seen new implementation difficulties, especially with early curves. Point
addition formulas would work, unless you were adding a point to itself. You
have to check that input points are on the curve, or leak the secret key
modulo some small order. These are real implementation problems, even though
we know how to solve them.

This is nothing compared to the difficulties implementing SIDH. Currently,
SIDH security arguments rely on honest peers. A peer that gives you a
pathological input can utterly break the security of the scheme. To make
matters worse, while we understand how to verify inputs for elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman, we don't have a way to verify inputs for isogeny-based
cryptography at all. We don't have much research to fall back on here
either. This isn't a SIDH-specific problem; post-quantum cryptography isn't
mature enough yet to have implementation issues like these nailed down
yet. (For an example from lattice-based cryptography, see the recent paper by
[Bindel et al][bindel].)

I don't want to diminish the importance of this paper in any way!  Just
because it's not something that your browser is going to be doing tomorrow
doesn't mean it's not an impressive accomplishment. It's just a step on the
path that might lead to production crypto one day.

**OK, fine. Why is this so different from elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman?**

While SIDH and ECDH both use elliptic curves, they're different beasts. SIDH
generates new curves to perform a DH exchange, whereas ECDH uses points on one
fixed curve. These supersingular curves also have different properties from
regular curves. Using a supersingular curve for regular elliptic curve
operations would be horribly insecure. If you have some background in elliptic
curves: supersingular curves have a tiny embedding degree, meaning that
solving the ECDLP over `F(p)` can easily be transformed into solving the DLP
over `F(p^n)` where `n` is that small embedding degree. Most curves have large
embedding degrees, meaning that solving the ECDLP directly is easier than
translating it into a DLP and then solving that.  You generally have to go out
of your way to find a curve with a small embedding degree. That is only done
in specialized systems, like for pairing-based cryptography, or, as in this
case, supersingular isogeny-based Diffie-Hellman.

Let's recap ECDH. Public keys are points on a curve, and secret keys are
numbers. Alice and Bob agree on the parameters of the exchange ahead of time,
such as the curve *E* and a generator point *P* on that curve. Alice picks a
secret integer *a* and computes her public key *aP*. Bob picks a secret
integer *b* and computes his public key *bP*. Alice and Bob send each other
their public keys, and multiply their secret key by the other peer's public
key. Since *abP = baP*, they compute the same secret. Since an attacker has
neither secret key, they can't compute the shared secret.

SIDH is different. Secret keys are isogenies...

**Whoa whoa whoa. What the heck are isogenies?**

An isogeny between elliptic curves is a function from one elliptic curve to
another that preserves base points. That means it takes points on one curve
and returns points on the other curve. Every point on the input curve will map
to a point on the output curve; but multiple points may map to the same
point. Formally speaking, the isogeny is surjective. An isogeny is also a
homomorphism, that is, it preserves the structure of the curve. For any two
points P and Q, `phi(P + Q) = phi(P) + phi(Q)`.

We have a bunch of formulas for generating isogenies from a curve and a
point. You might remember that the set of values a function takes is its
"domain", and the set of values it returns is called its "codomain". The
domain of such an isogeny is the curve you give it; its codomain might be the
same curve, or it might be a different one. In general, for SIDH, we care
about the case where it produces a new curve.

**OK, so explain how SIDH works again.**

Roughly speaking, a secret key is an isogeny, and a public key is an elliptic
curve. By "mixing" their isogeny with the peer's public curve, each peer
generates a secret curve. The two peers will generally generate different
curves, but those curves will have the same j-invariant.

**Wait, what's a j-invariant?**

The j-invariant is a number you can compute for a particular curve. Perhaps
the best analogy would be the discriminant for quadratic equation you might
remember from high school math; it's a single number that tells you something
interesting about the underlying curve. There are different formulas for
curves in different forms. For example, for a curve in short Weierstrass form
`y^2 = x^3 + ax + b`, the j-invariant is:

```
j(E) = (1728 * 4a^3)/(4a^3 + 27b^2)
```

The j-invariant has a few cool properties: for example, while this is the
formula for the short Weierstrass form, the value of j doesn't change if you
put the same curve in a different form. Also, all curves with the same
j-invariant are isomorphic. However, for SIDH you don't really care about
these properties; you just care that the j-invariant is a number you can
compute and it'll be the same for the two secret curves that are generated by
the DH exchange.

**OK, try explaining SIDH again.**

The protocol fixes a supersingular curve E and four points on that
curve: P_A, Q_A, P_B, Q_B.

Alice picks two random integers, m_A and n_A. She takes a linear combination
of those two integers with P_A and Q_A to produce a random point R_A, so:

```
R_A = n_A * P_A + m_A * Q_A
```

That random point defines Alice's secret isogeny through the isogeny formulas
I talked about above. The codomain of that isogeny forms Alice's public
curve. Alice transforms points P_B and Q_B with the isogeny. She sends Bob her
public curve, and the two transformed points.

Bob does the same thing, except with A and B swapped.

Once Alice gets Bob's public key, she applies m_A and n_A again to the
corresponding transformed points she got from Bob. She generates a new isogeny
phiBA from the resulting point just like she did before to generate her
private key. That isogeny's codomain will be an elliptic curve E_BA.

When Bob performs his side of the exchange, he'll produce a different isogeny
and a different elliptic curve E_AB; but it will have the same j-invariant as
the curve Alice computed.  That j-invariant is the shared key.

I've compiled a [transcript][transcript] of a Diffie-Hellman exchange using
Sage so you can see a (toy!) demo in action.

**I know a little about elliptic curves. I thought they were always
non-singular. What's a supersingular elliptic curve but a contradiction in
terms?**

You're right! Supersingular elliptic curves are somewhat confusingly
named. Supersingular elliptic curves are still elliptic curves, and they are
non-singular just like all other elliptic curves. The "supersingular" refers
to the singular values of the j-invariant. Equivalently, the Hasse invariant
will be 0.

**So, why does it matter that the curve is supersingular?**

Firstly, computing the isogeny is much easier on supersingular curves than on
ordinary (not supersingular) elliptic curves. Secondly, if the curve is
ordinary, the scheme can be broken in subexponential time by a quantum
attacker.

Isogeny-based cryptography using ordinary curves was considered as a
post-quantum secure cryptosystem before SIDH. However, Childs et al. showed a
subexponential quantum algorithm in 2010. This paper appeared to have ended
isogeny-based cryptography: it was already slower than other post-quantum
systems, and now it was shown that it wasn't even post-quantum secure.

Because supersingular curves are rare, they had not previously been considered
for isogeny-based cryptography. However, the paper itself suggested that
supersingular curves might be worth examining, so it ended up pushing research
in a new direction rather than ending it.

Explaining why the supersingular curve makes the problem quantum-hard is
tricky without being thoroughly familiar with isogenies and quantum
computing. If you're really interested, [the Childs paper][childs] explains
how the quantum attack in the ordinary case works. Informally, in the ordinary
case, there is a group action (the *isogeny star operator*) of the ideal class
group onto the set of isomorphism classes of isogenous curves with the same
endomorphism ring. That can be shown to be a special case of the abelian group
hidden shift problem, which can be solved quickly on a quantum computer. In
the supersingular case, there is no such group action to exploit. (If you're
trying to solve for this at home; this is why SIDH needs to define the 4
points P_A, P_B, Q_A, Q_B.)

*I would like to thank Thomas Ptacek for reviewing this blog post and bearing
with me as I struggle through trying to come up with human-readable
explanations for all of this stuff; Sean Devlin for reminding me that Sage is
an excellent educational tool; and Watson Ladd for pointing out a correction
w.r.t the Hasse invariant (the Hasse-Witt matrix is undefined, not
singular.). Finally, I'd like to thank all the people who reviewed drafts of
this post, including (in no particular order) Bryan Geraghty, Shane Wilton,
Sean Devlin, Thomas Ptacek, Tanner Prynn, Glyph Lefkowitz and Chris Wolfe.*
