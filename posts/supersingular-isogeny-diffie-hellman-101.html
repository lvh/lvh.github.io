<p>Craig Costello, Patrick Longa and Michael Naehrig, three cryptographers at
Microsoft Research, recently published a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/413">paper</a> on supersingular
isogeny Diffie-Hellman. This paper garnered a lot of interest in the security
community and even made it to the front page of Hacker News. Most of the
discussion around it seemed to be how no-one understands isogenies, even
within cryptography-literate communities. This article aims to make that a
little bit better.</p>
<p>This post assumes that you already know how Diffie-Hellman works in the
abstract, and that you know elliptic curves are a mathematical construct that
you can use to perform Diffie-Hellman operations, just like you can with the
integers <em>mod p</em> (that would be "regular" Diffie-Hellman). If that was
gibberish to you and you'd like to know more, check out <a href="https://www.crypto101.io">Crypto 101</a>, my
free introductory book on cryptography. You don't need a math background to
understand those concepts at a high level. The main difference is that Crypto
101 sticks to production cryptography, while this is still experimental.</p>
<p>It's not surprising that isogeny-based cryptography is so confusing. Up until
recently, it was unambiguously in the realm of research, not even close to
being practically applicable. Its mathematical underpinnings are much more
complex than regular elliptic curves, let alone integers <em>mod p</em>. It also
looks superficially similar to elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman, which only adds
to the confusion.</p>
<p>With that, let's begin!</p>
<p><strong>What is this paper about?</strong></p>
<p>Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) is one of a handful of
"post-quantum" cryptosystems. Those are cryptosystems that will remain secure
even if the attacker has access to a large quantum computer. This has nothing
to do with quantum cryptography, like quantum key distribution, beyond their
shared quantum mechanical underpinning.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I care about quantum computers?</strong></p>
<p>General quantum computers can solve different problems than classical
    computers can. Classical computers can emulate quantum computers, but only
with exponential slowdown. A sufficiently large quantum computer could break
most production cryptography, including cryptosystems based on the difficulty
of factoring large numbers (like RSA), taking discrete logs over the integers
<em>mod p</em> (like regular DH), or taking discrete logs over elliptic curves (like
ECDH and ECDSA). To quantify that, consider the following table:</p>
<p><img alt="quantum computer attack cost versus classical" src="../img/post-quantum/quantum-computer-relative-cost.png"></p>
<p>In this table, n refers to the modulus size for RSA, and the field size for
ECC. Look at the rightmost column, which represents time taken by the
classical algorithm, and compare it to the "time" columns, which represent how
much a quantum computer would take. As <em>n</em> increases, the amount of time the
quantum computer would take stays in the same ballpark, whereas for a
classical computer it increases (almost) exponentially. Therefore, increasing
n is an effective strategy for keeping up with ever-faster classical
computers, but it is ineffective at increasing the run time for a quantum
computer.</p>
<p><strong>Aah! Why isn't everyone panicking about this?!</strong></p>
<p>The good news is that these computers don't exist yet.</p>
<p>If you look at the qubits column, you'll see that these attacks require large
universal quantum computers. The state of the art in those only has a handful
of qubits. In 2011, IBM successfully factored 143 using a 4-qubit quantum
computer. Scaling the number of qubits up is troublesome. In that light,
larger key sizes may prove effective after all; we simply don't know yet how
hard it is to build quantum computers that big.</p>
<p>D-wave, a quantum computing company, has produced computers with 128 and 512
qubits and even &gt;1000 qubits. While there is some discussion if D-waves
provide quantum speedup or are even real quantum computers at all; there is no
discussion that they are not <em>universal</em> quantum computers. Specifically, they
only claim to solve one particular problem called quantum annealing. The 1000
qubit D-Wave 2X can not factor RSA moduli of ~512 bits or solve discrete logs
on curves of ~120 bits.</p>
<p>The systems at risk implement asymmetric encryption, signatures, and
Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. That's no accident: all post-quantum
alternatives are asymmetric algorithms. Post-quantum secure symmetric
cryptography is easier: we can just use bigger key sizes, which are still
small enough to be practical and result in fast primitives. Quantum computers
simply halve the security level, so all we need to do is use secure ciphers
with 256 bit keys, like Salsa20.</p>
<p>Quantum computers also have an advantage against SIDH, but both are still
exponential in the field size. The SIDH scheme in the new paper has 192 bits
of security against a classical attacker, but still has 128 bits of security
against a quantum attacker. That's in the same ballpark as most symmetric
cryptography, and better than the 2048-bit RSA certificates that underpin the
security of the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this paper special?</strong></p>
<p>Post-quantum cryptography has been firmly in the realm of academic research
and experiments. This paper makes significant advancements in how practically
applicable SIDH is.</p>
<p><strong>Being future-proof sounds good. If this makes it practical, why don't we
start using it right now?</strong></p>
<p>SIDH is a young cryptosystem in a young field, and hasn't had the same level
of scrutiny as some of the other post-quantum cryptosystems, let alone the
"regular" cryptosystems we use daily. Attacks only get better, they never get
worse. It's possible that SIDH is insecure and we just don't know how to break
it yet. It does have a good argument for why quantum algorithms wouldn't be
able to crack it (noncommutativity and a lack of internal structure to
exploit), but that's a hypothesis, not a proof.</p>
<p>The new performance figures from this paper are impressive, but they're still
much slower than the systems we use today. Key generation and key exchange
take a good 50 million cycles or so each. That's about a thousand times slower
than Curve25519, a curve designed about 10 years ago. Key sizes are also much
larger: SIDH public keys are 751 bytes, whereas Curve25519 keys are only 32
bytes. For on-line protocols like HTTPS, that's a significant cost.</p>
<p>Finally, there are issues with implementing SIDH safely. Systems like
Diffie-Hellman over integers <em>mod p</em> are much less complex than elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), let alone SIDH. With ECDH and ECC in general, we
started seeing implementation difficulties, especially with early
curves. Point addition formulas would work, unless you were adding a point to
itself. You have to check that input points are on the curve or leak the
secret key modulo some small order. These are real implementation problems,
even though we know how to solve them.</p>
<p>This is nothing compared to the difficulties implementing SIDH. Currently,
SIDH security arguments rely on honest peers. A peer that gives you a
pathological input can utterly break the security of the scheme. To make
matters worse, while we understand how to solve these problems for elliptic
curve Diffie-Hellman, we don't have a way to verify inputs for isogeny-based
cryptography at all. We don't have much research to fall back on here either.</p>
<p>I don't want to diminish the importance of this paper in any way!  Just
because it's not something that your browser is going to be doing tomorrow
doesn't mean it's not an impressive accomplishment. It's just a step on the
path that might lead to production crypto one day.</p>
<p><strong>OK, fine. Why is this so different from Diffie-Hellman?</strong></p>
<p>While SIDH and ECDH both use elliptic curves, they're different beasts. As
I've mentioned before, their superficial similarities probably does more to
confuse than to help. SIDH generates new curves as a matter of course within a
single DH exchange. With ECDH, that only happens during an attack. These
supersingular curves also have different properties from regular curves.</p>
<p>Let's recap ECDH. Public keys are points on a curve, and secret keys are
numbers. Alice and Bob agree on the parameters of the exchange ahead of time,
such as the curve <em>E</em> and a generator point <em>P</em> on that curve. Alice picks a
secret integer <em>a</em> and computes her public key <em>aP</em>. Bob picks a secret
integer <em>b</em> and computes his public key <em>bP</em>. Alice and Bob send each other
their public keys, and multiply their secret key by the other peer's public
key. Since <em>abP = baP</em>, they compute the same secret. Since an attacker has
neither secret key, they can't compute the shared secret.</p>
<p>SIDH is different. Secret keys are isogenies...</p>
<p><strong>Whoa whoa whoa. What the heck are isogenies?</strong></p>
<p>An isogeny between elliptic curves is a dense morphism (think "function") from
one elliptic curve to another that preserves base points. That means it takes
points on one curve and returns points on the other curve.</p>
<p>We have a bunch of formulas for generating isogenies from a curve and a
point. You might remember that the kinds of values a function takes is its
"domain", and the kinds of values it returns is it's "codomain". The domain of
such an isogeny is the curve you give it; its codomain is a new curve.</p>
<p><strong>OK, so explain how SIDH works again.</strong></p>
<p>Roughly speaking, a secret key is an isogeny, and a private key is an elliptic
curve. The protocol fixes a supersingular curve E and four points on that
curve: PA, QA, PB, QB.</p>
<p>Alice picks two random points, mA and nA. She takes a linear combination of
those two points with PA and QA to produce a random point RA. That random
point, through the isogeny formulas I talked about above, defines Alice's
secret isogeny. The codomain of that isogeny forms Alice's public curve. Alice
transforms points PB and QB with the isogeny. Alice sends Bob her public
curve, and the two transformed points.</p>
<p>Bob does the same thing, except with A and B swapped.</p>
<p>Once Alice gets Bob's public key, she applies mA and nA again to the
corresponding transformed points she got from Bob. She generates a new isogeny
phiBA from the resulting point just like she did before to generate her
private key. That isogeny's codomain will be an elliptic curve EBA.</p>
<p>When Bob performs his side of the exchange, he'll produce a different isogeny
and a different elliptic curve EAB; but it will have the same
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/j-Invariant.html">j-invariant</a> as the curve Alice computed. The j-invariant isn't
particularly complicated magic; for a curve in Weierstrass form, it's a simple
function of the curve coefficients:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>j(E) = (1728 * 4a^3)/(4a^3 + 27b^2)
</pre>


<p>That j-invariant is the shared key.</p>
<p>I've compiled a <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38476311/Supersingular%20Isogeny%20Elliptic%20Curve%20Cryptography%20--%20Sage.pdf">transcript</a> of a Diffie-Hellman exchange using
Sage so you can see a (toy!) demo in action.</p>
<p><strong>I know a little about elliptic curves. I thought they were always
non-singular. What's a supersingular elliptic curve but a contradiction in
terms?</strong></p>
<p>You're right! Supersingular elliptic curves are somewhat confusingly
named. Supersingular elliptic curves are still elliptic curves, and they are
non-singular just like all other elliptic curves. The "supersingular" refers
to the singular values of the j-invariant. Equivalently, the Hasse-Witt matrix
will be singular as well (and therefore the Hasse invariant will be 0).</p>
