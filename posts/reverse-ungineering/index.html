<p>(Title with apologies to Glyph.)</p>
<p>Recently, some friends of mine suggested that "software engineer" is
not a good job title. While they are of course free to call their
profession whatever they like, I respectfully disagree: I think
"engineer" is a perfectly cromulent description of what we do.</p>
<p>This is an opinion piece. Despite arriving at opposite conclusions,
the disagreement is feathery at best.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-if-buildings-failed-as-often-as-software-projects">
<h2>What if buildings failed as often as software projects?</h2>
<p>To illustrate the differences between software development and other
engineering disciplines, Glyph compares software to civil engineering.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to getting things done, we're just not very
good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most software projects fail; as of 2009, 44% are late, over budget,
or out of specification, and an additional 24% are canceled
entirely. Only a third of projects succeed according to those
criteria of being under budget, within specification, and complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such shenanigans would never be accepted in a Serious Engineering
Discipline, like civil engineering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you want to live in a city where almost a quarter of all the
buildings were simply abandoned half-constructed, or fell down
during construction? Where almost half of the buildings were missing
floors, had rents in the millions of dollars, or both?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I certainly wouldn't.</p>
<p>Computers are terrible, but not quite <em>that</em> bad, as Glyph points
out. "Failure" simply means something different for software projects
than it does for construction projects. Many of those "failed"
software projects were quite successful by other measures; the problem
isn't with software projects, it's with applying civil engineering
standards to a project that isn't.</p>
<p>Software projects aren't civil engineering projects.  Attempts to
treat them as such have done much more harm than good. That said, that
doesn't mean that software development isn't engineering.</p>
<p>Firstly, civil engineering is the outlier here. Other engineering
disciplines don't do well according to the civil engineering success
yardstick either. The few engineering endeavors that do are usually
civil engineering in disguise, such as the construction of nuclear and
chemical plants.  Rank-and-file projects in most fields of engineering
operate a lot more like a software project than the construction of a
skyscraper. Projects are late and over budget, often highly
experimental in nature, and in many cases also subject to changing
requirements. It's true that we just can't plan ahead in software, but
we're not the only ones.</p>
<p>Secondly, we may be confounding cause and effect, even if we overlook
that not all engineering is civil engineering. Are software projects
unable to stick to these standards because it's not engineering, or is
civil engineering the only thing that sticks to them because <em>they
have no other choice</em>? Conversely, do we fail early and often because
we're not engineering, or because, unlike civil engineering projects,
we <em>can</em>? <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#anthropic" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>Finally, software has existed for decades, but buildings have for
millennia. Bridges used to collapse all the time. Tacoma Narrows
wasn't so long ago. If the tour guide on my trip to Paris is to be
believed, one of those bridges has collapsed four times already.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-this-isn-t-science">
<h2>But this isn't science!</h2>
<p>Supposedly, software engineering isn't "real" engineering because,
unlike "real" engineering, it is not backed by "real" science or math.
This statement is usually paired with a dictionary definition of the
word "engineering".</p>
<p>I feel this characterization is incongruent with the daily reality of
engineering.</p>
<p>Consider the civil engineer, presumably the engineeringest engineer
there is. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#civil" id="id2">2</a> If you ask me to dimension an I-beam for
you, I would:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>spitball the load,</p></li>
<li><p>draw a free-body diagram,</p></li>
<li><p>probably draw a shear and moment diagram,</p></li>
<li><p>and pick the smallest standard beam that'll do what you want.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to know how far that beam is going to go, I'll draw you
some conjugate beams. I would also definitely <em>not</em> use the
moment-area theorem, even though it wouldn't be too difficult for the
reasonable uses of an I-beam.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, someone inflicted a variety of theories on me.
Euler-Bernouilli beam theory, for example. Very heavy textbooks with
very heavy math. Neither my physical therapist nor my regular one
expect me to ever <em>truly</em> recover. Nonetheless, area moments and
section moduli are the only way to understand where the <code class="docutils literal">I</code> in
I-beam comes from.</p>
<p>Nasty math didn't prevent me from dimensioning that I-beam. And I do
really mean <em>math</em>, not physics: Euler-Bernouilli is a math hack. You
get it by taking Hooke's law and throwing some calculus at it. Hooke's
law itself is more math than physics, too: it's a first-order
approximation based only on the observation that stuff stretches when
you pull it. It's wrong all the time, even for fairly germane objects
like rubber bands. Both theories were put together long before we had
materials science. We use them because they (mostly) work, not because
they are a consequence of a physical model.</p>
<p>That was just one example from a single discipline, but it holds more
generally, too. I analyze circuits by recognizing subsections. If you
show me a piece that looks like a low-pass filter, I am not distracted
by Maxwell's equations to figure out what that little capacitor is
doing.  I could certainly derive its behavior that way; in fact,
someone made me do that once, and it was quite instructive. But I'm
not bothered with the electrodynamics of a capacitor right now; I'm
just trying to understand this circuit!</p>
<p>This isn't just how engineers happen to do their jobs in practice,
either. Engineering breakthroughs live on both sides of science's
cutting edge. When Shockley et al. first managed to get a transistor
to work, we didn't really understand what was going on. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#tor" id="id3">3</a> Carnot
was building engines long before anyone realized he had stumbled upon
one of the most fundamental properties of the universe. Nobody was
doing metaphysics. Sadi wanted a better steam engine.</p>
<p>To me, saying that I-beam was dimensioned with the help of beam theory
is about as far from the truth as saying that a software project was
built with the help of category theory. I'm sure that there's some way
that that thing I just wrote is a covariant functor and you can
co-Yoneda your way to proving natural isomorphism, but I don't <em>have</em>
to care in order to successfully produce some software. It's easy to
reduce an applied field to <em>just</em> the application of that field, but
that doesn't make it so; especially if we haven't even really figured
out the field yet.</p>
<p>So, even if the math and science behind computer engineering is
somehow less real than that other math and science, I think that
difference is immaterial, and certainly not enough to make us an
entirely different profession.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-that-isn-t-art">
<h2>But <em>that</em> isn't art!</h2>
<p>Many people smarter than I have made the argument that programming is
art, not dissimilar from painting, music or even cooking. I'm
inclined to agree: many talented programmers are also very talented
artists in other fields. However, I do disagree that those things are
art-like <em>unlike</em> engineering, which is supposedly just cold, hard
science.</p>
<p>There's a not-so-old adage that science is everything we understand
well enough to explain to a computer, and art is everything else. If
that's true, there's definitely plenty of art to be found in
engineering. (That was a little tongue-in-cheek. Nobody wants to get
dragged into a semantic argument about what art <em>is</em>.)</p>
<p>Even with a much narrower view of art, engineers do plenty of it, as
I've tried to argue before. Not all engineering calls are direct
consequences of relativity, thermodynamics or quantum
mechanics. Sometimes, it is really just down to what the engineer
finds most palatable. Even civil engineers, the gray predictable
stalwarts of our story, care about making beautiful things. The Burj
Khalifa wasn't a consequence of a human following an algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think the similarities run deep. I hope we don't throw that away
essentially just because our field is a little younger. We're all
hackers here; and we're all engineers, too.</p>

<p>I suppose this is really analogous to the anthropic
principle, except applied to engineering disciplines
instead of humans.</p>

<dd>
<p>I'm using civil engineer here in the strict American sense
of person who builds targets, as opposed to the military
engineer, who builds weapons. Jokes aside, perhaps this is
related to the disagreement. Where I come from, "civil
engineer" means "advanced engineering degree", and
encompasses many disciplines, including architectural (for
lack of better word; I mean the American "civil engineer"
here), chemical, electrical, and yes, computer.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="label" id="tor"><span class="brackets"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id3">3</a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>While it is very easy to make up a sensible-sounding
narrative time line after the fact for the breakthroughs in
physics and engineering that eventually made the transistor
possible, this ignores the strong disagreements between
theoretical predictions and practical measurements of the
time. Regardless of their cause, it would be foolish to
assume that Shockley just sat down and applied some theory.
The theory just wasn't there yet.</p>
