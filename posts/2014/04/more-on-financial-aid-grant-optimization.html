<p>In <a href="http://www.lvh.io/blog/2014/03/10/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid/">a previous post</a>, I talked about ways to optimize PyCon
financial aid grants. This is a follow-up on those efforts. Quick
recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a fixed budget \(b\) available for grants, between 100k
  and 200k USD.</li>
<li>There are a number of people (approximately 300) requesting various
  amounts \(r_i\) (approximately between 100 USD and 2000 USD) of
  financial aid, and receive a grant \(g_i\) so that \(0 \le g_i
  \le r_i\).</li>
<li>Financial aid applicants can be assigned scores \(s_i\), a
  relative value describing how much we'd like to have them at PyCon.</li>
<li>PyCon wants to optimize the total expected value of scores. That
  means getting as many people as possible to come, weighted by score.</li>
<li>We've conjectured that we can estimate the probability \(p_i\)
  that someone attends as either \(g_i/r_i\), or \((g_i/r_i)^2\).
  The former prefers to spread the budget across a larger number of
  smaller grants, whereas the latter prefers to focus the budget into
  a smaller number of larger grants.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of that doesn't make sense, you should read
<a href="http://www.lvh.io/blog/2014/03/10/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid/">the previous blog post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In short, we're trying to solve the optimization problem:</p>
<p>$$\max \sum E[S_i] = \sum s_i \cdot p_i$$</p>
<p>Since most optimization texts appear to prefer minimization,
alternatively:</p>
<p>$$\min - \sum s_i \cdot p_i$$</p>
<p>Subject to a budget constraint and an individual grant constraint:</p>
<p>$$\sum g_i \le b$$</p>
<p>$$0 \le g_i \le r_i$$</p>
<p>The greater-than-zero constraint for individual grants is fairly
important, otherwise the algorithm might casually give you answers
like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">k = 1: [ 10.  20. -20.  30.  50.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
</pre>


<p>That list in the middle are the per-person grants. Notice how the
algorithm feels that the third person really ought to pony up some
cash so that some of the other people can go to PyCon ;-)</p>
<h3>Squared problems</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.lvh.io/blog/2014/03/10/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid/">previous blog post</a> I ran into issues using a very
generic constraint solver. I ended that post saying that I would try
to remeedy that by applying a more specific solver that takes
advantage of a particular structure of the problem.</p>
<p>When you set \(p_i = g_i/r_i\), this turns into a linear programming
problem, since \(r_i\) is a constant. When you set \(p_i =
\left(g_i/r_i\right)^2\), it turns into a quadratic programming
problem. Turns out there's two things I missed about the quadratic
problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resulting problem is not convex. That means it's (probably)
  difficult to solve.</li>
<li>The estimated probability that someone will attend falls off sharply
  as soon as they don't receive the full amount they requested. At 50%
  of the requested grant, the estimated probability of attending is
  only 25%; at 90%, it's 81%. This is the opposite of what we want.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixing the model</h3>
<p>That doesn't mean we should put the \((g_i/r_i)^k\) out to pasture:
it just means that I didn't pick the \(k\) I really wanted.
Specifically, if I were to pick \(k=1/2\), I'd get:</p>
<p>$$p_i = \left(\frac{g_i}{r_i}\right)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\frac{g_i}{r_i}}$$</p>
<p>In general, if  \(k = 1/n\):</p>
<p>$$p_i = \left(\frac{g_i}{r_i}\right)^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{\frac{g_i}{r_i}}$$</p>
<p>That problem <em>is</em> convex, but it isn't linear, quadratic, or some
other easy specific problem. It's just constrained multivariate convex
optimization. That's okay, there are still a couple of applicable
optimization algorithms.</p>
<p>Some of these algorithms require the derivative of the goal function
with respect to a particular grant size \(g_j\) at a particular
point. In case we don't have the real derivative, we can still provide
a numerical approximation. In our case, we don't really need to
approximate, since the derivatives are fairly easy to compute
analytically:</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial}{\partial g_j} \sum_i s_i \cdot
\sqrt[n]{\frac{g_i}{r_i}} = \frac{s_j \cdot {g_j}^{\frac{1}{n} -
1}}{\sqrt[n]{r_j} \cdot n}$$</p>
<h3>Finding a solution with Python</h3>
<p>There are a few Python packages that contain optimization algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>SciPy</li>
<li>cvxopt</li>
<li>pyopt</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone originally pointed me towards cvxopt. While I'm sure it's
excellent software, I already knew SciPy, so I went with that.</p>
<p>SciPy's optimization module provides the following algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>fmin_l_bfgs_b</code> - Zhu, Byrd, and Nocedal's constrained optimizer</li>
<li>
<code>fmin_tnc</code> - Truncated Newton code</li>
<li>
<code>fmin_cobyla</code> - Constrained optimization by linear approximation</li>
<li>
<code>fmin_slsqp</code> - Minimization using sequential least-squares programming</li>
<li>
<code>nnls</code> - Linear least-squares problem with non-negativity constraint</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two are not applicable because they only appear to support
bounds on individual variables. I also need a constraint over the
<em>sum</em> of variables for the budget:  \(\sum g_i \le b\). The last one
isn't applicable because this isn't a linear least-squares problem.
That leaves <code>cobyla</code> and <code>slsqp</code>.</p>
<h3>Experimenting with linear approximation (COBYLA)</h3>
<p>Making COBYLA work ended up being pretty easy. The only non-trivial
part is expressing all your constraints as expressions greater than or
equal to zero.</p>
<p>I've uploaded my IPython notebook
(<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/lvh/10107818">viewer</a>,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/lvh/10107818">gist</a>).</p>
<p>This produced the following results:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">scores: [1 1 1 2 3 5 5]
requested: [10 20 30 30 50 10 50] total: 200, budget: 150
k = 1/0.5: [ 10.  20.  30.  30.  50.  10.   0.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/1: [ 10.  -0.   0.  30.  50.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/2: [ 10.  10.   7.  27.  36.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/3: [ 10.  11.   9.  25.  35.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/5: [ 10.  11.  10.  24.  35.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/10: [ 10.  11.  11.  23.  35.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/100: [ 10.  11.  11.  23.  34.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
</pre>


<p>Some takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As predicted, as \(1/k\) increases, the optimization gradually
  starts spreading the budget out more evenly; preferring to give many
  partial grants rather than a few large ones.</li>
<li>This effect is mostly only pronounced for \(1/k = 2, 3\); after
  that, increasing \(1/k\) doesn't make much of a difference
  anymore. This is what I'd expect when I visualize the \(p_i\)
  functions in my head, but I haven't ruled out numerical instability.</li>
<li>Even at high \(1/k\), the two high scorers get their full grant
  amount. That's quite understandable for the one that's only asking
  for 10, but even the one asking for a large grant gets it
  unconditionally. This probably means that tweaking the scoring
  functions is going to be very important.</li>
<li>The linear version is apparently already quite brutal: the person
  with score 3 requesting 50 simply gets it entirely, leaving no
  budget left over for the people with score 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I'm so pleased with these results, I'm skipping <code>slsqp</code> until I
feel like it. Next up, I'll try to compare the COBYLA results above
with the results of the greedy algorithm under various fitness
metrics.</p>
