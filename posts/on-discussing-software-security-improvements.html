    <div>
<p>A common criticism of information security folks is that they tend to
advise people to not do any crypto. Through projects like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.crypto101.io/">Crypto
101</a>, I've attempted to make a small contribution towards fixing
that.</p>
<p>In the open source world, various people often try to improve the
security of a project. Because designing secure systems is pretty
hard, they often produce flawed proposals. The aforemetioned tendency
for infosec-conscious people to tell them to stop doing crypto is
experienced as unwelcoming, even dismissive. Typically, the only thing
that's accomplished is that a lot of feelings get hurt; it seems to
only rarely result in improved software.</p>
<p>I think that's quite unfortunate. I think open source is great, and we
should be not just welcoming and inclusive, but aiming to produce
secure software. Furthermore, even if a flawed proposal is
unsalvageable, a clear description of <em>why</em> it is flawed will
presumably result in fewer negative interactions. Best case scenario,
the issues with a proposal can be discussed and potentially rectified.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve this situation, I'm documenting what I believe
to be a useful way to discuss security changes and their tradeoffs. As
Zooko has taught me:</p>
<blockquote>
Security isn't about perfect versus imperfect or about better versus
worse, it's about <em>this</em> attack surface versus <em>that</em> attack
surface.</blockquote>
<p>This document aims to be the equivalent of an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sscce.org/">SSCCE</a> for generic bug
reports: a blueprint for making suggestions likely to lead to
productive discourse, as long as we can agree that we're trying to
produce more secure software, as well as provide a welcoming
development environment.</p>
<div class="section" id="important-points">
<h2>Important points</h2>
<p>A good proposal should contain:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A brief description of what you're suggesting.</li>
<li>A description of the attack model you're considering, why the
current system does not address this issue, and why the suggested
system <em>does</em> address this issue.</li>
<li>A motivation of the attack model. Why is it important that this
issue is actually addressed?</li>
<li>How does this change affect the attack surface (i.e. all of the
ways an attacker can attempt to attack a system)?</li>
<li>What does the user experience for all users of the system look
like? Many cryptosystems fall over because they're simply unusable
for most users of the system.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-example">
<h2>An example</h2>
<p>Wul (the widely underestimated language, pronounced <em>/wool/</em>) is a
general purpose programming language. It has a package repository,
WuPI (the Wul package index, pronounced <em>/woopie/</em>), the de facto
standard for distributing and installing Wul software.</p>
<p>WuPI uses TLS as a secure transport. The WuF (Wul foundation,
pronounced <em>/woof/</em>), maintains a root certificate, distributed with
Wul. Thanks to a well-managed system of intermediary CAs run by a
tireless army of volunteers, this means that both package authors and
consumers know they're talking to the real WuPI.</p>
<p>Alice is the WuPI BDFL. Bob is a Wul programmer, and would like to
improve the security of WuPI.</p>
<p>While consumers and authors know that they're talking to the real
WuPI, there is no protection against a malicious WuPI endpoint. (This
problem was recently made worse because WuPI introduced a CDN, greatly
increasing the number of people who could own a node.). You know that
you're talking to something with a WuF-signed certificate (presumably
WuPI, provided the WuF has done a good job managing that certificate),
but you have no idea if that thing is being honest about the packages
it serves you.</p>
<p>Bob believes WuPI could solve this by using GPG signatures.</p>
<p>He starts with a brief description of the suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
I would like to suggest that WuPI grows support for GPG signatures
of packages. These signatures would be created when a package author
uploads a package. They would optionally be verified when the user
downloads a package.</blockquote>
<p>He continues with the attack model being considered:</p>
<blockquote>
I believe this would secure WuPI consumers against a malicious WuPI
endpoints. A malicious WuPI endpoint (assuming it acquires an
appropriate certificate) is currently free to deliver whatever
packages it wants.</blockquote>
<p>He explains why the current model doesn't address this:</p>
<blockquote>
The current system assures authenticity and secrecy of the stream
(through TLS), and it ensures that the server authenticates itself
with a WuPI/WuF certificate. It does not ensure that the package is
what the author uploaded.</blockquote>
<p>He explains why he believes his model does address this:</p>
<blockquote>
Because the signatures are produced by the author's GPG key, a
malicious WuPI endpoint would not be able to forge them. Therefore,
a consumer is sure that a package with a valid signature is indeed
from the author.</blockquote>
<p>He explains why this attack model is important:</p>
<blockquote>
With the new CDN support, the number of people with access to such a
certificate has greatly increased. While I certainly trust all of
the volunteers involved, it would be nice if we didn't <em>have</em> to.
Furthermore, the software on the servers can always be vulnerable to
attack; as a high-value target, it certainly isn't inconceivable
that an attacker would use an unknown vulnerability to take over a
WuPI endpoint.</blockquote>
<p>He (believes to) address the attack surface:</p>
<blockquote>
Because the signatures are optional, the attack surface remains the
same.</blockquote>
<p>Finally, he addresses the user experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The weak point of this scheme is most likely the user experience,
because users historically seem to dislike using GPG.</p>
<p>I am hopeful that this increased value of participating in the GPG
web of trust will mean that more people participate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alice reviews this, and notes a flaw in the proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
This proposal aims to address a security flaw when the WuPI endpoint
is malicious by adding signatures. However, a malicious WuPI
endpoint can lie by omission, and claim a package was never signed
by the author.</blockquote>
<p>Bob now realizes this issue, and suggests an improvement:</p>
<blockquote>
This could be rectified if the user insists on a signature for
packages they expect to be signed.</blockquote>
<p>As a side note, Alice notes that the attack surface does increase:</p>
<blockquote>
This places trust in author's ability to manage private keys, which
has historically been shown to be problematic. That introduces a new
attack vector: an attacker can attempt to go after the author's
private key.</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of this conversation, there actually was a
conversation. I believe this to be an improvement over the overall
status quo.</p>
