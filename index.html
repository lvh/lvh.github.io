<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://www.lvh.io/posts/were-just-getting-started.html">in my previous post</a>, we have a long way to go when it comes to information security. I'll be presenting <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/342/">a talk on building secure systems</a> at PyCon 2015 next month, and I hope to blog more about interesting bits of comprehensible security.</p>
<p>I believe strongly in the importance of a threat models. A threat model is your idea of what you're protecting against. It may seem obvious that you can't effectively protect anything without knowing what you're protecting it from. Sadly, simply contemplating your threat model puts you ahead of the curve in today's software industry.</p>
<p>Threat models often simply deal with how much effort you're willing to spend to prevent something from happening. In a world with finite resources, we have to make choices. Some models are unrealistic or prohibitively expensive to defend against. These questions aren't all strictly technical: perhaps some risk is adequately covered by insurance. Perhaps you have a legal or a compliance requirement to do something, even if the result is technically inferior. These questions are also not just about <em>how much</em> you're going to do: different threat models can lead to mutually exclusive resolutions, each a clear security win.</p>
<p>Consider your smartphone. Our phones have a lot of important, private information; it makes sense to protect them. The iPhone 6 provides two options for the lock screen: a passcode and a fingerprint sensor. Passcodes have been around for about as long as smartphones have, while fingerprint sensors are new and exciting. It's clear that either of them is more secure than not protecting your phone at all. But which one is more secure?</p>
<p>Most people instinctively feel the fingerprint sensor is the way to go. Biometric devices feel advanced; up until recently, they only existed in Hollywood. Fingerprints have their share of issues. It's impossible to pick a new key or have separate keys for separate capabilities; you're stuck with the keys you have. A fingerprint is like a password that you involuntarily leave on everything you touch. That said, turning a fingerprint into something that will unlock your iPhone is out of reach for most attackers.</p>
<p>Passcodes aren't perfect either. People generally pick poor codes: important dates and years are common, but typically not kept secret in other contexts. If you know someone's birthday, there's a decent chance you can unlock their phone. At least with a passcode, you have the option of picking a good one. Even if you do, a passcode provides little protection against shoulder surfing. Most people unlock their phone dozens of times per day, and spend most of that day in the presence of other people. A lot of those people could see your passcode inconspicuously.</p>
<p>Two options. Neither is perfect. How do you pick one? To make an informed choice, you need to formalize your threat models.</p>
<p>In the United States, under the Fifth Amendment, you don't have to divulge information that might incriminate you. I am not a lawyer, and courts have provided conflicting rulings, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Computer_passwords">but currently it appears that this includes computer passwords.</a> <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2014/10/police-can-require-cellphone-fingerprint-not-pass-code?wpisrc=nl-swbd&amp;wpmm=1#">However, a court has ruled that a fingerprint doesn't count as secret information.</a> If you can unlock your phone with your fingerprint, they can force you to unlock it.</p>
<p>If your threat models include people snooping, the fingerprint sensor is superior. If your threat model includes law enforcement, the passcode is superior. So, which do you pick? It depends on your threat model.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: this is an illustration of how threat models can conflict. It is <em>not</em> operational security advice; in which case I would point out other options. It is not legal advice, which I am not at all qualified to dispense.</p>

<p>Most conference talks are transactional. The speaker has a point to
make. After the presentation, it's "over"; only spoken about in
perfect tenses. You've communicated your thoughts, perhaps had a
conversation or two, but, mostly, moved on.</p>
<p>I've given talks like these. However, about two years ago, I gave a
talk that had a deep impact on my life. That talk was Crypto 101.</p>
<p>Right before the presentation, cryptanalytic research was released
that popped RC4. I couldn't have asked for a better setup. Turns out
it wasn't <em>just</em> luck; eventually our systemic failure as an industry
in taking security seriously was bound to catch up with us. Since
then, the proverbial piper has been well-paid. We've seen a plethora
of serious security bugs. Huge corporations have been the victims of
attacks in the billions of dollars a pop. As I'm writing this blog
post, there's an article on a new TLS attack in my reading list.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear that this wasn't just a one-off thing. I
started writing <a href="http://crypto101.github.io">Crypto 101, the book,</a> not too long after
giving the talk. We were, unwittingly, at the crest of a wave that's
still growing. Projects like PyCA and LibreSSL started fighting
tirelessly to make the software we use better. Security talks became a
mandatory part of the programming conference food pyramid. My friends
Hynek and Ying gave fantastic talks. They, too, got "lucky" with a
security bombshell: Heartbleed happened mere days before the
conference.</p>
<p>Last week, I presented Crypto 101 again at rax.io, Rackspace's
internal conference. It was well-received, and I think I provided
value for people's time. One thing, more than anything, it
crystallized where we are. We're not done yet. There's still a huge
audience left to reach. Interest in information security has done
nothing but grow.  With a total of just over 100,000 downloads for the
book and about half as many for the recording of the presentation,
people are definitely listening. We've made real impact, and we have
people's attention, but we need to keep going.</p>
<p>One of the two talks I'll be giving at PyCon is a more high-level
overview of how we can build secure systems. More friends of mine will
talk in about TLS there too. Within Rackspace, I'm focusing on
information security. There are awesome things brewing here, and I
hope that we can continue the great work we've been doing so far.</p>
<p>We've accomplished a lot, but we're just getting started.</p>

<p>This message is also available <a href="https://gist.github.com/lvh/6adfe51aa42bb268a273">as a Gist</a>. I have also updated

Hash: SHA512

I am cycling my GPG key.

My old key has fingerprint:

D9DC 4315 772F 8E91 DD22 B153 DFD1 3DF7 A8DD 569B

My new key has fingerprint:

45DC 13EB 6A01 21E8 5219 8C09 8763 869B E2B2 663E

(If you're looking for the key ID, that's the last 8 hex characters of
the fingerprint.)

While my new key may superficially seem less secure, since I have gone
from a 4096 bit RSA key to a 3072 bit one, the new one has the
wonderful advantage of living on a smart card.

I have no reason to presume my old key to be compromised.  I have
changed the expiration date of my old key to March 7th of this year. I
have signed the new key with the old one.

I am in the process of updating https://keybase.io/lvh.

<p>Imagine that you had a capability URL, except instead of giving you
the ability to perform a specific <em>action</em>, it gave you the ability to
perform a (limited) set of operations on a third party API,
e.g. OpenStack. The capability URL wouldn't just be something you
exercise or revoke; it'd be an API endpoint, mostly indistinguishable
from the real API. Incoming requests would be inspected, and based on
a set of rules, either be rejected or forwarded to the API being
shimmed.</p>
<h2>Proof of concept</h2>
<p>At my day job, we had a programming task that I thought logic
programming would be well-suited for. Unfortunately, logic programming
is kind of weird and esoteric. Even programmers with otherwise broad
experiences professed to not being quite sure how it worked, or what
to do with it.</p>
<p>Therefore, I used up my hack day (a day where we get to hack on random
projects) to cook up some cool stuff using logic programming. I demoed
the usual suspects (<a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/blob/master/src/shimmer/monkey.clj">the monkey with the banana</a>, and a
<a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/blob/master/src/shimmer/sudoku.clj">sudoku solver</a>), illustrating the difference between the
relational nature of the logic programs and the imperative nature of
the algorithms you might otherwise write to solve the same problems.
Finally, I demoed the aforementioned proxying API shim. The proof of
concept, codenamed shimmer, is <a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/">up on Github</a>.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the handler function, which takes incoming
requests and modifies them slightly so they can be passed on:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">build-handler</span>

                                        <span class="ss">:throw-exceptions</span> <span class="nv">false</span><span class="p">))]</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">spy</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">request</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">spy</span> <span class="nv">modified-request</span><span class="p">))))</span>

       <span class="ss">:body</span> <span class="s">"Doesn't match!"</span><span class="p">})))</span>
</pre>


<p>(Those <code>spy</code> calls are from the excellent <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre"><code>timbre</code></a>
library. They make it easy to log values without cluttering up your
code; a godsend while developing with some libraries you're not
terribly familiar with.)</p>
<p>The matching function looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">match</span>
  <span class="s">"Checks if the request is allowed."</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">req</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">not= </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/run</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">q</span><span class="p">]</span>

           <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nf">l/featurec</span> <span class="nv">req</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:request-method</span> <span class="ss">:get</span><span class="p">})]</span>

                                       <span class="s">"the right header value"</span><span class="p">}})]</span>
           <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nf">l/featurec</span> <span class="nv">req</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:request-method</span> <span class="ss">:post</span><span class="p">})</span>

                                       <span class="s">"another right header value"</span><span class="p">}})]))</span>
        <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">()))</span>
</pre>


<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>Make this thing actually vaguely correct. That means e.g. also
inspecting the body for URL references, and changing those to go
through the proxy as well.</p>
<p>Start collecting a library of short hand notations for specific API
functionality, e.g. if you're proxying an OpenStack API, you should be
able to just say you want to allow server creation requests, without
having to figure out exactly what those requests look like.</p>
<p>The spec is hard-coded, it should be specified at runtime. That was
trickier than I had originally anticipated: the vast majority of
<code>core.logic</code> behavior uses macros. While some functionality is fairly
easy to port, that's probably a red herring: I don't want to port a
gazillion macros. As an example, here's <code>conds</code>, which is just<code>conde</code>
as a function (except without support for logical conjunction per
disjunctive set of goals):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="o">^</span><span class="ss">:private</span> <span class="nv">conds</span>
  <span class="s">"Like conde, but a function."</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">goals</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">empty?</span> <span class="nv">goals</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nv">l/fail</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/conde</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nb">first </span><span class="nv">goals</span><span class="p">)]</span>
             <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nf">conds</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">rest </span><span class="nv">goals</span><span class="p">))])))</span>
</pre>


<p>That's not the worst function, but let's just say I see a lot of
<code>macroexpand</code> in my future if I'm going to take this seriously.</p>
<p>URLs and bodies should be parsed, so that you can write assertions
against structured data, or against URL patterns, instead of specific
URLs.</p>
<p>If I ever end up letting any of this be a serious part of my day job,
I'm going to invest a ton of time improving the documentation for both
<code>core.logic</code> and <code>core.typed</code>. They're <em>fantastic</em> projects, but
they're harder to get started with than they could be, and that's a
shame.</p>

<p>(Title with apologies to Glyph.)</p>
<p>Recently, some friends of mine suggested that "software engineer" is
not a good job title. While they are of course free to call their
profession whatever they like, I respectfully disagree: I think
"engineer" is a perfectly cromulent description of what we do.</p>
<p>This is an opinion piece. Despite arriving at opposite conclusions,
the disagreement is feathery at best.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-if-buildings-failed-as-often-as-software-projects">
<h2>What if buildings failed as often as software projects?</h2>
<p>To illustrate the differences between software development and other
engineering disciplines, Glyph compares software to civil engineering.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to getting things done, we're just not very
good:</p>
<blockquote>
Most software projects fail; as of 2009, 44% are late, over budget,
or out of specification, and an additional 24% are canceled
entirely. Only a third of projects succeed according to those
criteria of being under budget, within specification, and complete.</blockquote>
<p>Such shenanigans would never be accepted in a Serious Engineering
Discipline, like civil engineering:</p>
<blockquote>
Would you want to live in a city where almost a quarter of all the
buildings were simply abandoned half-constructed, or fell down
during construction? Where almost half of the buildings were missing
floors, had rents in the millions of dollars, or both?</blockquote>
<p>I certainly wouldn't.</p>
<p>Computers are terrible, but not quite <em>that</em> bad, as Glyph points
out. "Failure" simply means something different for software projects
than it does for construction projects. Many of those "failed"
software projects were quite successful by other measures; the problem
isn't with software projects, it's with applying civil engineering
standards to a project that isn't.</p>
<p>Software projects aren't civil engineering projects.  Attempts to
treat them as such have done much more harm than good. That said, that
doesn't mean that software development isn't engineering.</p>
<p>Firstly, civil engineering is the outlier here. Other engineering
disciplines don't do well according to the civil engineering success
yardstick either. The few engineering endeavors that do are usually
civil engineering in disguise, such as the construction of nuclear and
chemical plants.  Rank-and-file projects in most fields of engineering
operate a lot more like a software project than the construction of a
skyscraper. Projects are late and over budget, often highly
experimental in nature, and in many cases also subject to changing
requirements. It's true that we just can't plan ahead in software, but
we're not the only ones.</p>
<p>Secondly, we may be confounding cause and effect, even if we overlook
that not all engineering is civil engineering. Are software projects
unable to stick to these standards because it's not engineering, or is
civil engineering the only thing that sticks to them because <em>they
have no other choice</em>? Conversely, do we fail early and often because
we're not engineering, or because, unlike civil engineering projects,
we <em>can</em>? <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/reverse-ungineering.html#anthropic" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Finally, software has existed for decades, but buildings have for
millennia. Bridges used to collapse all the time. Tacoma Narrows
wasn't so long ago. If the tour guide on my trip to Paris is to be
believed, one of those bridges has collapsed four times already.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-this-isn-t-science">
<h2>But this isn't science!</h2>
<p>Supposedly, software engineering isn't "real" engineering because,
unlike "real" engineering, it is not backed by "real" science or math.
This statement is usually paired with a dictionary definition of the
word "engineering".</p>
<p>I feel this characterization is incongruent with the daily reality of
engineering.</p>
<p>Consider the civil engineer, presumably the engineeringest engineer
there is. <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/reverse-ungineering.html#civil" id="id2">[2]</a> If you ask me to dimension an I-beam for
you, I would:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>spitball the load,</li>
<li>draw a free-body diagram,</li>
<li>probably draw a shear and moment diagram,</li>
<li>and pick the smallest standard beam that'll do what you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to know how far that beam is going to go, I'll draw you
some conjugate beams. I would also definitely <em>not</em> use the
moment-area theorem, even though it wouldn't be too difficult for the
reasonable uses of an I-beam.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, someone inflicted a variety of theories on me.
Euler-Bernouilli beam theory, for example. Very heavy textbooks with
very heavy math. Neither my physical therapist nor my regular one
expect me to ever <em>truly</em> recover. Nonetheless, area moments and
section moduli are the only way to understand where the <tt class="docutils literal">I</tt> in
I-beam comes from.</p>
<p>Nasty math didn't prevent me from dimensioning that I-beam. And I do
really mean <em>math</em>, not physics: Euler-Bernouilli is a math hack. You
get it by taking Hooke's law and throwing some calculus at it. Hooke's
law itself is more math than physics, too: it's a first-order
approximation based only on the observation that stuff stretches when
you pull it. It's wrong all the time, even for fairly germane objects
like rubber bands. Both theories were put together long before we had
materials science. We use them because they (mostly) work, not because
they are a consequence of a physical model.</p>
<p>That was just one example from a single discipline, but it holds more
generally, too. I analyze circuits by recognizing subsections. If you
show me a piece that looks like a low-pass filter, I am not distracted
by Maxwell's equations to figure out what that little capacitor is
doing.  I could certainly derive its behavior that way; in fact,
someone made me do that once, and it was quite instructive. But I'm
not bothered with the electrodynamics of a capacitor right now; I'm
just trying to understand this circuit!</p>
<p>This isn't just how engineers happen to do their jobs in practice,
either. Engineering breakthroughs live on both sides of science's
cutting edge. When Shockley et al. first managed to get a transistor
to work, we didn't really understand what was going on. <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/reverse-ungineering.html#tor" id="id3">[3]</a> Carnot
was building engines long before anyone realized he had stumbled upon
one of the most fundamental properties of the universe. Nobody was
doing metaphysics. Sadi wanted a better steam engine.</p>
<p>To me, saying that I-beam was dimensioned with the help of beam theory
is about as far from the truth as saying that a software project was
built with the help of category theory. I'm sure that there's some way
that that thing I just wrote is a covariant functor and you can
co-Yoneda your way to proving natural isomorphism, but I don't <em>have</em>
to care in order to successfully produce some software. It's easy to
reduce an applied field to <em>just</em> the application of that field, but
that doesn't make it so; especially if we haven't even really figured
out the field yet.</p>
<p>So, even if the math and science behind computer engineering is
somehow less real than that other math and science, I think that
difference is immaterial, and certainly not enough to make us an
entirely different profession.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-that-isn-t-art">
<h2>But <em>that</em> isn't art!</h2>
<p>Many people smarter than I have made the argument that programming is
art, not dissimilar from painting, music or even cooking. I'm
inclined to agree: many talented programmers are also very talented
artists in other fields. However, I do disagree that those things are
art-like <em>unlike</em> engineering, which is supposedly just cold, hard
science.</p>
<p>There's a not-so-old adage that science is everything we understand
well enough to explain to a computer, and art is everything else. If
that's true, there's definitely plenty of art to be found in
engineering. (That was a little tongue-in-cheek. Nobody wants to get
dragged into a semantic argument about what art <em>is</em>.)</p>
<p>Even with a much narrower view of art, engineers do plenty of it, as
I've tried to argue before. Not all engineering calls are direct
consequences of relativity, thermodynamics or quantum
mechanics. Sometimes, it is really just down to what the engineer
finds most palatable. Even civil engineers, the gray predictable
stalwarts of our story, care about making beautiful things. The Burj
Khalifa wasn't a consequence of a human following an algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think the similarities run deep. I hope we don't throw that away
essentially just because our field is a little younger. We're all
hackers here; and we're all engineers, too.</p>

<p>Most classic turn-based games, from chess all the way to Civilization
V, are sequential in nature. A player makes a move, then the next
player makes a move, and so on. The details can vary, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There could be two players, or multiple. This number is tightly
bound for scaling reasons, which we'll discuss later.</li>
<li>The game could have perfect information, like chess, where all
players see a move as soon as it is played. The game could also have
imperfect information, like Civilization V, where players see part
of a move, but the effets may be obscured by fog of war.</li>
<li>The players may play in a consistent order (chess, Civilization V),
or in a somewhat random one (D&amp;D's initiative system).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those things are more or less orthogonal to the turn system.
Players play turns sequentially, so I'm going to call these
<em>sequential turn-based games</em>.</p>
<p>Sequential turns make scaling the number of players up difficult. Even
with only 8 players, any given player will spend most of their time
waiting. While 8 players are a lot for most turn-based games, it's
nothing compared to an MMORPG.</p>
<p>An alternative to <em>sequential</em> turn-based play is <em>simultaneous</em>
turn-based play. In simultaneous turn-based play all players issue
their moves at the same time, and all moves are played out at the same
time. The simplest example is rock-paper-scissors, but Diplomacy works
the same way. More recently, this system has been explored by the
top-down tactical game <a class="reference external" href="http://www.frozensynapse.com/">Frozen Synapse</a>.</p>
<p>While simultaneous turn-based play gets us closer to making massively
multiplayer turn-based games feasible by turning a linear scaling
problem into a constant time one, we're not quite out of the woods
yet.</p>
<p>Consider what happens when a player does not make a move. There are a
few reasons that might happen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The player is not playing the game right now.</li>
<li>The player has stopped playing the game altogether.</li>
<li>The player may be in a hopeless position, where stalling is better
than losing. (Stalling may tie up lots of enemy resources.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've ever gotten frustrated at a multiplayer game that has a
"ready" system before you begin a game, but had to wait because one of
the players disappeared; this is essentially the problem turn-based
games face <em>every turn</em>.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to mitigate this problem. Games can
duplicate playing fields. That works for both sequential games like
Hero Academy and simultaneous ones like Frozen Synapse. If a player
doesn't make a move, that particular instance of the game world
doesn't go anywhere; but you can play any number of games
simultaneously.</p>
<p>For this strategy to work, the playing fields have to be independent.
You don't lose heroes or soldiers because they're stuck on some stale
game. The worst possible outcome is that your game statistics don't
reflect reality.</p>
<p>That works, but rules out a permanent game world with shared
resources. If there's a larger story being told, you would want these
worlds to be linked somehow: be it through shared resources, or
because they're literally the same game world.</p>
<p>There's a number of creative ways to get out from under that problem,
usually by involving wall-clock time. For example, if a player doesn't
respond within a fixed amount of time, they may forfeit their turn.
Fuel consumption might be based on wall-clock time, not turns. <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/on-multiplayer-turn-based-game-mechanics.html#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>
There's a lot of degrees of freedom here. Do you use a global clock,
or one local to a particular area?</p>
<p>A global clock is probably simpler, but poses some game play
challenges. How long is the tick? Too fast, and a player may see their
empire annihilated while they're sleeping. Too slow, and the most
trivial action takes forever. There isn't necessarily one right
answer, either. In an all-out cataclysmic struggle between two
superpowers, a complete tactical battle plan may take a long time. Any
timescale that isn't frustratingly short for that situation will be
frustratingly long for anyone trying to guide their spaceship (or
kodo, depending which universe you're in) across the Barrens.</p>
<p>Local clocks have their own share of difficulties. You still need to
answer what happens for anything that isn't in a particular battle;
you still need to answer what happens when battles merge or diverge.</p>
<p>I'm currently exploring the shared global clock. In order to mitigate
the issues I described, I'm contemplating two ideas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Allow programmable units; a la Screeps, CodeWars...</li>
<li>Allow players to plan several turns ahead of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are, of course, not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>I'm considering renaming the project to its plural, hypercathexes,
because then it can be about a hyper cat in a bunch of hexes.</p>
<p>The only real constraints I started with was that I wanted a
simultaneous turn-based space game on a hex grid.</p>
<p>Amit Patel from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redblobgames.com">Red Blob Games</a> has basically the awesomest page
about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">hex grids</a>, and a ton of awesome pages about many other areas
of game development. I think it's a fantastic resource for programmers
like myself who don't do game dev as a day job, but just want to make
a little game on the side.</p>
<p>Simultaneous turn-based means that all players plan their moves
simultaneously, and they are then also executed simultaneously. This
has an interesting scaling effect. On the one hand, it clearly scales
better to many players, because players "play" simultaneously. On the
other hand, you start getting interesting problems. For example, clock
synchronization. Does the entire world advance with the same tick-tock
pattern? What happens when a player does <em>not</em> make a move within the
allotted time? If you allow different clocks in the world, does time
advance faster if both players submit a move, or do you always wait
until the maximum timeout?</p>
<p>I wanted an excuse to play with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a> and found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/plexus/chestnut">Chestnut</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lvh/hypercathexis/tree/d454da2b1d8c1cf491fc3cd7dba83ee1b2bd4c76">first version</a> had a working hex grid, but displayed it using
offset coordinates. I wanted to work using axial coordinates as much
as possible, because it makes a lot of math so much easier. Axial
coordinates work together with the "grain" of the hex map:</p>
<object data="img/AxialBaseVectors.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
axial base vectors</object>
<p>Second thing I did was move from individual <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tags produced by
Om to a single <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;svg&gt;</tt> with hexes (<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;polygon&gt;</tt>) inside it. This
fixed a number of annoying placement issues with CSS. CSS really wants
to position things based on bounding box, not midpoints. That's great
for web pages, not so much for my hex grid. I ran into a number of
annoying issues where certain hex borders would be wider than others.
Browsers aren't made to draw hex grids based on left/right offsets, I
guess...</p>
<p>I started by expressing distances in the SVG in terms of the hex
width, which would become my unit. The height would then be
\(\sqrt{3}/2\). Then, I realized that I could make my life easier by
expressing all x coordinates in terms of a single hex width, and all y
coordinates in terms of a single hex height; then I could just scale
differently across x and y at the end.</p>
<img alt="Simple SVG hex grid" src="img/BasicSVGHexGrid.png">
<p>Developing in Firefox was mostly painless, but I discovered many
discrepancies once trying it in Chrome. Things that should be the same
aren't, particularly when it comes to transforms. For example, Chrome
would occasionally literally do the inverse of the scaling it was
supposed to:</p>
<img alt="Differences in scaling behavior across browsers" src="img/HexGridCrossBrowserScalingIssues.png">
<p>I guess trying to implement things in browsers was a mistake.</p>

<p>It's no secret that I love Clojure. Like any tool though, it isn't
perfect. Today, I was trying to write unit tests that use
<tt class="docutils literal">clojure.core.async/timeout</tt>, so I wrote a test double analogous to
Twisted's <tt class="docutils literal">Clock</tt>. As I tried to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">with-redefs</span></tt> it in, I got the
most inscrutable error message out: <tt class="docutils literal">java.lang.ClassCastException:
icecap.handlers.delay_test$fake_timeout$timeout__22934 cannot be cast
to clojure.lang.IFn$LO</tt>.</p>
<p>Wha? I know <tt class="docutils literal">clojure.lang.IFn</tt>, Clojure's function type, but what
the heck is a <tt class="docutils literal">clojure.lang.IFn$LO</tt>?</p>
<p>Searching for the term didn't give any particularly useful results. It
was clear this happened when I was redeffing the original <tt class="docutils literal">timeout</tt>,
so I looked at its documentation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
clojure.core.async/timeout
([msecs])
Returns a channel that will close after msecs
</pre>
<p>Doesn't look too special to me. What's the type of that thing, anyway?
Let's find out:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (parents (type timeout))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$LO clojure.lang.AFunction}
</pre>
<p>Aha! So that is actually part of <tt class="docutils literal">timeout</tt>, not something else wonky
going on. What does the source say? It's a pretty lame shim:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(defn timeout
"Returns a channel that will close after msecs"
[^long msecs]
(timers/timeout msecs))
</pre>
<p>I mean, nothing interesting there, just a type hint.</p>
<p>Oh. Wait. That's not just a type hint. <tt class="docutils literal">long</tt> is a primitive.
Testing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (parents (type (fn [^long x] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$LO clojure.lang.AFunction}
</pre>
<p>Aha! Due to a JVM quirk, functions with a primitive type hint are
special. That works for doubles, too:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DO clojure.lang.AFunction}
</pre>
<p>And multiple arguments:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x ^double y] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DDO clojure.lang.AFunction}
&gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x ^long y] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DLO clojure.lang.AFunction}
</pre>
<p>Adding a simple type hint to the function fixed it. Success!</p>

<p>A common criticism of information security folks is that they tend to
advise people to not do any crypto. Through projects like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.crypto101.io/">Crypto
101</a>, I've attempted to make a small contribution towards fixing
that.</p>
<p>In the open source world, various people often try to improve the
security of a project. Because designing secure systems is pretty
hard, they often produce flawed proposals. The aforemetioned tendency
for infosec-conscious people to tell them to stop doing crypto is
experienced as unwelcoming, even dismissive. Typically, the only thing
that's accomplished is that a lot of feelings get hurt; it seems to
only rarely result in improved software.</p>
<p>I think that's quite unfortunate. I think open source is great, and we
should be not just welcoming and inclusive, but aiming to produce
secure software. Furthermore, even if a flawed proposal is
unsalvageable, a clear description of <em>why</em> it is flawed will
presumably result in fewer negative interactions. Best case scenario,
the issues with a proposal can be discussed and potentially rectified.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve this situation, I'm documenting what I believe
to be a useful way to discuss security changes and their tradeoffs. As
Zooko has taught me:</p>
<blockquote>
Security isn't about perfect versus imperfect or about better versus
worse, it's about <em>this</em> attack surface versus <em>that</em> attack
surface.</blockquote>
<p>This document aims to be the equivalent of an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sscce.org/">SSCCE</a> for generic bug
reports: a blueprint for making suggestions likely to lead to
productive discourse, as long as we can agree that we're trying to
produce more secure software, as well as provide a welcoming
development environment.</p>
<div class="section" id="important-points">
<h2>Important points</h2>
<p>A good proposal should contain:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A brief description of what you're suggesting.</li>
<li>A description of the attack model you're considering, why the
current system does not address this issue, and why the suggested
system <em>does</em> address this issue.</li>
<li>A motivation of the attack model. Why is it important that this
issue is actually addressed?</li>
<li>How does this change affect the attack surface (i.e. all of the
ways an attacker can attempt to attack a system)?</li>
<li>What does the user experience for all users of the system look
like? Many cryptosystems fall over because they're simply unusable
for most users of the system.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="an-example">
<h2>An example</h2>
<p>Wul (the widely underestimated language, pronounced <em>/wool/</em>) is a
general purpose programming language. It has a package repository,
WuPI (the Wul package index, pronounced <em>/woopie/</em>), the de facto
standard for distributing and installing Wul software.</p>
<p>WuPI uses TLS as a secure transport. The WuF (Wul foundation,
pronounced <em>/woof/</em>), maintains a root certificate, distributed with
Wul. Thanks to a well-managed system of intermediary CAs run by a
tireless army of volunteers, this means that both package authors and
consumers know they're talking to the real WuPI.</p>
<p>Alice is the WuPI BDFL. Bob is a Wul programmer, and would like to
improve the security of WuPI.</p>
<p>While consumers and authors know that they're talking to the real
WuPI, there is no protection against a malicious WuPI endpoint. (This
problem was recently made worse because WuPI introduced a CDN, greatly
increasing the number of people who could own a node.). You know that
you're talking to something with a WuF-signed certificate (presumably
WuPI, provided the WuF has done a good job managing that certificate),
but you have no idea if that thing is being honest about the packages
it serves you.</p>
<p>Bob believes WuPI could solve this by using GPG signatures.</p>
<p>He starts with a brief description of the suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
I would like to suggest that WuPI grows support for GPG signatures
of packages. These signatures would be created when a package author
uploads a package. They would optionally be verified when the user
downloads a package.</blockquote>
<p>He continues with the attack model being considered:</p>
<blockquote>
I believe this would secure WuPI consumers against a malicious WuPI
endpoints. A malicious WuPI endpoint (assuming it acquires an
appropriate certificate) is currently free to deliver whatever
packages it wants.</blockquote>
<p>He explains why the current model doesn't address this:</p>
<blockquote>
The current system assures authenticity and secrecy of the stream
(through TLS), and it ensures that the server authenticates itself
with a WuPI/WuF certificate. It does not ensure that the package is
what the author uploaded.</blockquote>
<p>He explains why he believes his model does address this:</p>
<blockquote>
Because the signatures are produced by the author's GPG key, a
malicious WuPI endpoint would not be able to forge them. Therefore,
a consumer is sure that a package with a valid signature is indeed
from the author.</blockquote>
<p>He explains why this attack model is important:</p>
<blockquote>
With the new CDN support, the number of people with access to such a
certificate has greatly increased. While I certainly trust all of
the volunteers involved, it would be nice if we didn't <em>have</em> to.
Furthermore, the software on the servers can always be vulnerable to
attack; as a high-value target, it certainly isn't inconceivable
that an attacker would use an unknown vulnerability to take over a
WuPI endpoint.</blockquote>
<p>He (believes to) address the attack surface:</p>
<blockquote>
Because the signatures are optional, the attack surface remains the
same.</blockquote>
<p>Finally, he addresses the user experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The weak point of this scheme is most likely the user experience,
because users historically seem to dislike using GPG.</p>
<p>I am hopeful that this increased value of participating in the GPG
web of trust will mean that more people participate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alice reviews this, and notes a flaw in the proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
This proposal aims to address a security flaw when the WuPI endpoint
is malicious by adding signatures. However, a malicious WuPI
endpoint can lie by omission, and claim a package was never signed
by the author.</blockquote>
<p>Bob now realizes this issue, and suggests an improvement:</p>
<blockquote>
This could be rectified if the user insists on a signature for
packages they expect to be signed.</blockquote>
<p>As a side note, Alice notes that the attack surface does increase:</p>
<blockquote>
This places trust in author's ability to manage private keys, which
has historically been shown to be problematic. That introduces a new
attack vector: an attacker can attempt to go after the author's
private key.</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of this conversation, there actually was a
conversation. I believe this to be an improvement over the overall
status quo.</p>

<p>I've migrated from Octopress to Nikola.</p>
<p>Nothing personal. Octopress is fine software, but:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>External packages, like themes, made my installation quickly
impossible to understand and manage. What's the difference between
<tt class="docutils literal">javascripts</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">js</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">css</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">style</tt>? I don't know.</li>
<li>Performance. Nikola builds sites nearly instantly. Even with a
moderate amount of pages, I found Octopress too slow. Maybe I just
need a better laptop.</li>
<li>Python. While I'm sure the Ruby tools are of similar quality to
Python's; I <em>know</em> Python's tools. Porting to Nikola was easier
than learning about A-grade Ruby developer installations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I'm on Nikola now. Pretty happy with it. I used
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.github.com/mikemccracken/nikola-octopress-import">nikola-octopress-import</a>. Did most of what I wanted; I contributed
some minor PRs so that it would also handle extended date formats
(with seconds and timezones) and legacy HTML posts.</p>
