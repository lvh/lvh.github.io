<p>I'm excited to announce that I was invited to speak at PyCon
PL. Hence, I'm preparing to freshen up my arsenal of talks for the
coming year. The organizers have very generously given me a lot of
freedom regarding what to talk about.</p>
<p>I'd like to do more security talks as well as shift focus towards a
more technical audience, going more in-depth and touching on more
advanced topics.</p>
<h2>Candidates</h2>
<h3>Object-capability systems</h3>
<p>Capabilities are a better way of thinking about authorization. A
capability ("cap") gives you the authority to perform some action,
without giving you any other authority. Unlike role-based access
control systems, capability based systems nearly always fail-closed;
if you don't have the capability, you simply don't have enough
information to perform an action. Contrast this with RBAC systems,
where authorization constraints are enforced with pinky swears, and
therefore often subverted.</p>
<p>I think I can make an interesting case for capability systems to any
technical audience with some professional experience. Just talk about
secret management, and how it's nearly always terrifying! This gives
me an opportunity to talk about <code>icecap</code> and <code>shimmer</code>, my favorite
pastimes.</p>
<h3>Putting a backdoor in <code>RDRAND</code>
</h3>
<p>I've <a href="https://www.lvh.io/posts/2013/10/thoughts-on-rdrand-in-linux.html">blogged about this before</a> before, but I think I
could turn it into a talk. The short version is that Linux's PRNG
mixes in entropy from the <code>RDRAND</code> in a way that would allow a
malicious implementation to control the output of the PRNG in ways
that would be indistinguishable to a (motivated) observer.</p>
<p>As a proof of concept, I'd love to demo the attack, either in software
(for example, with QEMU) or even in hardware with an open core. I
could also go into the research that's been done regarding hiding
stuff on-die. Unfortunately, the naysayers so far have relied on
moving the goalposts continuously, so I'm not sure that would convince
them this is a real issue.</p>
<h3>Retroreflection</h3>
<p>An opportunity to get in touch with my languishing inner electrical
engineer! It turns out that when you zap radio waves at most hardware,
the reflection gets modulated based on what it's doing right now. The
concept became known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_%28codename%29">TEMPEST</a>, an NSA program. So far,
there's little public research on how feasible it is for your average
motivated hacker. This is essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking">van Eck phreaking</a>,
with 2015 tools. There's probably some interesting data to pick off of
USB HIDs, and undoubtedly a myriad of interesting devices controlled
by low-speed RS-232. Perhaps wireless JTAG debugging?</p>
<h2>The unfinished draft bin</h2>
<h3>Underhanded curve selection</h3>
<p>Another talk in the underhanded cryptography section I've considered
would be about underhanded elliptic curve selection. Unfortunately,
bringing the audience up to speed with the math to get something out
of it would be impossible in one talk slot. People already familiar
with the math are also almost certainly familiar with the argument for
rigid curves.</p>
<h3>Web app authentication</h3>
<p>Some folks asked for a tutorial on how to authenticate to web
apps. I'm not sure I can turn that into a great talk. There's a lot of
general stuff that's reasonably obvious, and then there's highly
framework-specific stuff. I don't really see how I can provide a lot
of value for people's time.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dreid">David Reid</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DLitz">Dwayne Litzenberger</a> made similar,
excellent points. They both recommend talking about object-capability
systems. Unlike the other two, it will (hopefully) actually help
people build secure software. Also, the other two will just make
people feel sad. I feel like those points generalize to all attack
talks; are they just not that useful?</p>

<p>For the past two years, I've been running PyCon's financial aid
program. Starting this year, the event coordinator has asked all staff
members to document what they do for PyCon. Firstly, this helps to
objectively recognize the hard work done by our (volunteer) staff, and
to help make sure there is continuity when the time comes to pass the
torch. Since organizers of other conferences have expressed interest
in my opinions for creating their own financial aid programs, I am
posting my notes publicly instead.</p>
<p>This is a collection of hard-earned opinions, and is very much work in
progress. It's written as if it were a conversation with a
hypothetical financial aid organizer; so, whenever I say "you", I mean
you, the awesome person running financial aid at a conference
somewhere.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Financial aid programs are one of the most effective ways a software
foundation can spend their money. Even if you completely ignore the
effect it has on diversity, the number of speakers, sprinters and
other contributors that attended PyCon thanks to the financial aid
program is staggering.</p>
<h3>Naming your program</h3>
<p>I inherited the term "Financial Aid". It's a fine term, but some other
conferences have come up with different terms that you may want to
consider, like "opportunity grants" and "diversity grants".</p>
<h3>Taking care of yourself</h3>
<p>Running a financial aid program is a lot of work. It scales linearly
with the number of applicants; it's your job to create a process that
keeps the work per applicant small, so that you can make the number of
applicants large. (You'll know you've succeeded when the fixed
overhead dominates, and it wouldn't really matter if you added another
dozen people.)</p>
<p>It is also an exercise in deferred gratification. Typically, you will
need to start preparing about a year before the conference. The
gratification part only comes at the conference itself. Since you'll
probably be quite busy as an organizer, it may only come after the
conference is over. You probably want to make sure that you have an
excellent social circle and that you're fairly self-motivated.</p>
<p>As the Financial Aid Chair, I have been on the receiving end of verbal
abuse once. Don't put up with it.</p>
<h3>Beat the drum</h3>
<p>Your financial aid program is useless if people don't know about it.</p>
<p>Some very talented speakers refrain from sending talk proposals
because they don't know if they can afford to attend.</p>
<h3>Numbers</h3>
<p>PyCon's financial aid program is quite large. There are a number of
reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>PyCon's financial aid program has been around for many years, so
  it's quite mature.</li>
<li>The program can count on support from PyCon leadership and the
  Python Software Foundation.</li>
<li>Because PyCon US is the largest PyCon in the world, it acts as a
  nexus for people across the globe; therefore, it's important for the
  Python community that as many people as possible have a chance to
  attend.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just to give you a ballpark idea of our numbers.</p>
<p>Regardless of what your numbers will be, expect that the primary
bottleneck of your financial aid program will simply be lack of funds.</p>
<h2>Confusing parts and sad truths</h2>
<h3>No-shows</h3>
<p>A lot of people will not show up, and not notify you (or notify you in
the days around the conference). Sometimes, there's good reasons
(illness, emergencies...). Sometimes, the reasons are less
great. Sometimes, you won't know the reason.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Financial Aid Chair, no-shows are
terrible. It's a dead grant: money that's been allocated that can't
easily be translated into an extra attendee. Hence, many of the
suggestions I make for running financial aid processes are focused on
minimizing no-shows.</p>
<h3>Visas and travel</h3>
<p>Many recipients have to cancel because they are unable to acquire
visas to Canada or the United States. In some cases, the visa process
took several months and simply did not complete in time for the
conference. In others the visas were declined for various reasons.</p>
<p>Occam's razor tells me that many countries, particularly the United
States, to some extent now Canada, but also Schengen zone countries
are simply actively hostile to foreigners visiting their country.</p>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<h3>Stand by your Chair</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, someone's responsible for making your
conference all it can be. That position is typically called the
Conference Chair. They get help from teams like the Program Committee
and Financial Aid to make that happen. At the end of the day they make
the hard calls, and you have to execute within their guidelines. That
typically includes the budget, but it also includes how you want to
allocate grants. You will almost certainly be resource-constrained, so
there are trade-offs to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to help newbies, or advanced programmers?</li>
<li>Do you want to help marginalized groups? Which ones? How much?</li>
<li>Do you want repeat attendees, or first timers?</li>
<li>Do you want a few people from all over the globe, or many locals?</li>
<li>Do you want to benefit people who directly contribute to the
  conference? Which ones (speakers, staff...)? How much?</li>
<li>Do we care if people are receiving funds from other places? What if
  their employer is paying? What if their employer is also a sponsor?
  Does it make sense for them to give us <em>x</em> sponsorship fees when
  we're giving them a significant portion of that back in financial
  aid?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your budget is, unfortunately, zero sum. Every group you benefit means
less for everyone else. Helping everyone is the same as helping
no-one. Everyone wants to help everyone, but it's unlikely you'll get
to do that. Make everyone understands exactly what you want to
accomplish; you don't want to have this argument in the middle of
trying to run a financial aid process.</p>
<h3>Free or reduced-price tickets</h3>
<p>For many conferences, the tickets themselves can be quite
expensive. It makes sense to provide them to financial aid recipients
at no (or reduced) charge as part of their grant.</p>
<p>PyCon previously provided free registration, but now provides
reduced-cost registration. This helps with no-shows, giving
applicants a financial incentive to let you know if they can't attend.</p>
<p>Make sure that you document clearly that people will be receiving
tickets, at what price they'll be receiving them, and that their spots
are reserved. Common concerns from financial aid applicants:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Your conference blog says that you're sold out, and I haven't
  received financial aid yet. Will I be able to attend?"</li>
<li>"I've already registered to reserve my spot; what do I do now that I
  get financial aid?"</li>
<li>"I'm a student. Will I still be able to register at the student rate
  if I apply for financial aid?"</li>
<li>"I applied for a larger amount because I didn't think ticket price
  would be included." (Unfortunately, most people tell you this far
  too late.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, clarity in communication is key here.</p>
<p>Previous years, PyCon optionally provided free registration for people
who asked. This optional part was somewhat confusing. Whatever you do,
make it part of the default grant application. That also means that
you should probably offer the reduced-price ticket to anyone who
applies for financial aid, even if you can't otherwise give them a
grant. Otherwise, someone who applies for financial aid for whom you
simply don't have enough funds will get punished twice: no financial
aid, and no access to early bird ticket price.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>Housing, in the context of financial aid, means that you pay for a
bunch of hotel rooms for various dates at your conference, and then
put financial aid recipients in them. To save costs, you want to pair
them up, and you want to utilize the rooms maximally.</p>
<p>Some people think that it's a good idea to organize housing as part of
your travel grants. Those people are mistaken. Housing is a terrible
idea all round:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't scale, up or down. If you're small, you can't negotiate a
  worthwhile hotel block contract. If you're big, the system crashes
  under its /O(N²)/ weight (see below).</li>
<li>It's not good for the financial aid recipients. While there are many
  nice things to be said about conference hotels, they are typically
  not economical. When we still organized housing, many financial aid
  recipients opted out: they could get significantly more bang for
  their buck otherwise.</li>
<li>It's not good for the conference. People leave, people join, people
  change dates, people have preferences (or hard constraints) about
  who they'll stay with... Doing this for any nontrivial number of
  people is a logistic nightmare; doing it for trivial number of
  people isn't worth it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having humans solve the allocation problem produces inefficiencies at
larger scales (i.e. humans typically come up with fairly suboptimal
solutions). It's a pretty tricky problem to solve even with computers
(believe me, I've <a href="https://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/03/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid.html">tried</a> <a href="http://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/03/optimal-hotel-room-pairing.html">extensively</a>), but computers
will never solve the logistic issues caused by human factors.</p>
<p>PyCon used to manage housing for financial aid recipients. Getting rid
of this was the single best decision I've ever made for the financial
aid process.</p>
<p>It worked out quite well for the attendees too. Providing simple tools
(i.e. the equivalent of a classifieds section) is more than ample to
help people find great groups to room-share with. This <em>increased</em>
opportunities for roomsharing, because it made it much less of a
hassle to mix-and-match between financial aid recipients and other
attendees.</p>
<p>Plenty of FA people stayed in large AirBnBs or the like in groups of 6
or more, and ended up getting fantastic deals that allowed them to
stay an extra few days to attend other events like sprints and
tutorials.</p>
<h2>Before the conference: from applications to allocation</h2>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>Keep it simple. Use a form generator (Google Forms or Wufoo or
something) for data collection. All of the processing was done with
simple Python scripts, most of it in an IPython/Jupyter notebook. This
enables you to create well-documented processes, which helps
everyone. CSV files are your best friend.</p>
<p>Make as many fields on the application form as possible directly
translatable to something in your allocation process. Multiple choice
and boolean values are your friend; the review process will make sure
the applications are accurate. Have free-form fields for documenting
things, but only use them in the review process. For example, you can
have a multiple choice field for Python expertise ranging from
beginner to expert, and then have a free-form field for applicants'
portfolios.</p>
<p>Names are weird. There are lots of falsehoods programmers believe
about names <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">(link)</a>. You probably want to ask for a legal
name; it's quite likely that you need to keep the legal name around
for your records. Ask a lawyer and/or an accountant for
details. However, you probably want to ask for an (optional) preferred
name as well, which you should always use when communicating with
them. There's a bunch of reasons those might be different, and people
may have excellent reasons for not using their legal names. For
example, a legal name might give someone away as being
transgender. Sometimes, you want to do that just for your /own/
convenience. People will put all sorts of stuff down as their "name",
but full legal names are quite consistent. This can be useful to match
up records from different sources, such as your registration database.</p>
<p>Speaking of gender, asking for people's gender is also tricky. Make
sure you have at least a cursory understanding of how gender works
before you ask. Always have a "decline to answer" button, which is
distinct from "other/nonbinary". If all you really want to know is
whether someone qualifies for earmarked funds, just ask the specific
question you want to know; e.g. "Apply for a PyLadies grant (people
who self-identify as women only, please)".</p>
<p>As usual in programming, state is the bane of your existence. Keep it
in one place whenever possible. A (Google Drive) spreadsheet works
just fine. Your scripts should operate on data extracted from them
(again, CSV works fine), but not store any state. This is trickier
than it sounds, but the alternative is that you'll probably end up
destroying some data.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>Reviews are easy to do in parallel, so get help from volunteers if
needed. Establish clear guidelines for what your discrete values
(e.g. Python experience) mean; not everyone agrees on what "expert"
means.</p>
<h3>Allocation</h3>
<p>I've <a href="https://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/03/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid.html">written about allocation before</a>.</p>
<p>PyCon allocates approximately 15% over budget; i.e. the budget that we
allocate is 1.15x the actual grant budget. This does not include aid
in the form of e.g. reduced ticket prices; remember to account for
those separately!</p>
<p>PyCon's no-show rate is somewhere between 10% and 20%, but it's very
hard to predict if the factors that contribute to that will affect
your conference equally.</p>
<p>As mentioned in that previous blog post, you don't always want to
allocate the full grant asked for. People will still be able to attend
with partial grants but typically wouldn't with an empty
grant. Therefore it typically makes sense to reduce everyone's grant
slightly if that allows you to provide more grants.</p>
<p>We ended up going with a fairly simple "flood fill" algorithm. An
applicant's score maps to a fraction of the budget:</p>
<p>$$f_i = \frac{s_i}{\sum_j s_j}$$</p>
<p>Where \(f_i\) is the fraction of the budget you're willing to assign
to applicant \(i\), \(s_i\) is an applicant's score.</p>
<p>If \(f_i \ge q \cdot r_i\) (where \(q\) is the fraction of the
grant you're willing to allocate and \(r_i\) is what the applicant
requested, you grant them \(q \cdot r_i\); otherwise, grant them 0.</p>
<p>Some applicants will be below this fraction, some will be above. They
could be below this fraction because they have a very high score
(e.g. they are a speaker), or because they're "low hanging fruit" and
not asking for very much money.</p>
<p>That means that if you run the algorithm again, the fractions will be
bigger; the people that received allocations in the previous round
were allocated less than what would've been their "fair share". Rinse,
repeat until you're out of money.</p>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>Have a central website where people can see their current status and
updates, both specific to the applicant and generic to the entire
process. Training people to expect information there will drastically
reduce the number of repetitive questions you get to answer by e-mail,
which will contribute enormously to your happiness. Therefore, if
people ask questions that are answered there; answer, be kind, but
point out where they could have gotten that information from.</p>
<p>Most of the things you will have to say will be generic points about
the process. Nonetheless, I have spent huge amounts of time answering
individual questions about that generic process, which got get quite
tedious. Hence, even a static page that doesn't show any information
specific to the applicant, but just explaining the process in detail
is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>Being up-front about how your process works is also great for
prospective applicants who wouldn't feel comfortable asking. This also
attracts speakers to submit talk proposals; many speakers would not
propose a talk because they know they can't afford to come without
financial aid. Therefore, it's important to communicate clearly if you
intend to support speakers, both through your financial aid
communication and your call for papers.</p>
<p>Once that fails, send e-mail. Once you're over a dozen or so
recipients, use <a href="http://www.mailgun.com/">Mailgun</a>. Emails
particularly automated from your personal email account is a good way
to get stuck in spam filters.</p>
<h2>Disbursement (giving out money)</h2>
<p>First off, talk to your treasurer. Possibly talk to a lawyer,
too. It's quite possible, particularly if you're in the United States,
that giving out a bunch of money as a non-profit comes with some
fairly complex strings attached. For example, you probably have
certain standards in terms of what records you have to keep.</p>
<p>As a European, I found it somewhat comical to still see checks in
active use, but hey; it works. For many parts of the world (apparently
not the United States, though) wire transfers are how you send money
to people. PayPal seems to work better for larger, established
organizations that use it often. There is less of a problem with the
accounts or funds being frozen. It does actively restrict (or, perhaps
more accurately, enforces restrictions on) sending funds to certain
countries, including Brazil and India.</p>
<p>Cash works, but is hard to scale. With PyCon's budget of well over
$100,000.00, managing cash is clearly less than ideal.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, be pragmatic. Do whatever your recipients can
accept. Be sure to ask ahead of time, as your financial aid programs
may prove to be successful in bringing people in from very different
countries, with very different cultures and very different means
available to them for accepting your grant. This is the case for
PyCon, but I consider that a superb problem to have.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'd like to thank the following people in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ewa Jodlowska, for managing PyCon and being the love of my life</li>
<li>Van Lindberg, for continuously inspiring me to serve</li>
<li>Diana Clarke, for Charing PyCon US in Montreal</li>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://www.lvh.io/posts/were-just-getting-started.html">in my previous post</a>, we have a long way to go when it comes to information security. I'll be presenting <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/342/">a talk on building secure systems</a> at PyCon 2015 next month, and I hope to blog more about interesting bits of comprehensible security.</p>
<p>I'm a strong believer in the importance of threat models. A threat model is your idea of what you're protecting against. It may seem obvious that you can't effectively protect anything without knowing what you're protecting it from. Sadly, simply contemplating your threat model puts you ahead of the curve in today's software industry.</p>
<p>Threat models often simply deal with how much effort you're willing to spend to prevent something from happening. In a world with finite resources, we have to make choices. Some models are unrealistic or prohibitively expensive to defend against. These questions aren't all strictly technical: perhaps some risk is adequately covered by insurance. Perhaps you have a legal or a compliance requirement to do something, even if the result is technically inferior. These questions are also not just about <em>how much</em> you're going to do: different threat models can lead to mutually exclusive resolutions, each a clear security win.</p>
<p>Consider your smartphone. Our phones have a lot of important, private information; it makes sense to protect them. The iPhone 6 provides two options for the lock screen: a passcode and a fingerprint sensor. Passcodes have been around for about as long as smartphones have, while fingerprint sensors are new and exciting. It's clear that either of them is more secure than not protecting your phone at all. But which one is more secure?</p>
<p>Most people instinctively feel the fingerprint sensor is the way to go. Biometric devices feel advanced; up until recently, they only existed in Hollywood. Fingerprints have their share of issues. It's impossible to pick a new key or have separate keys for separate capabilities; you're stuck with the keys you have. A fingerprint is like a password that you involuntarily leave on everything you touch. That said, turning a fingerprint into something that will unlock your iPhone is out of reach for most attackers.</p>
<p>Passcodes aren't perfect either. People generally pick poor codes: important dates and years are common, but typically not kept secret in other contexts. If you know someone's birthday, there's a decent chance you can unlock their phone. At least with a passcode, you have the option of picking a good one. Even if you do, a passcode provides little protection against shoulder surfing. Most people unlock their phone dozens of times per day, and spend most of that day in the presence of other people. A lot of those people could see your passcode inconspicuously.</p>
<p>Two options. Neither is perfect. How do you pick one? To make an informed choice, you need to formalize your threat models.</p>
<p>In the United States, under the Fifth Amendment, you don't have to divulge information that might incriminate you. I am not a lawyer, and courts have provided conflicting rulings, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Computer_passwords">but currently it appears that this includes computer passwords.</a> <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2014/10/police-can-require-cellphone-fingerprint-not-pass-code?wpisrc=nl-swbd&amp;wpmm=1#">However, a court has ruled that a fingerprint doesn't count as secret information.</a> If you can unlock your phone with your fingerprint, they can force you to unlock it.</p>
<p>If your threat models include people snooping, the fingerprint sensor is superior. If your threat model includes law enforcement, the passcode is superior. So, which do you pick? It depends on your threat model.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: this is an illustration of how threat models can conflict. It is <em>not</em> operational security advice; in which case I would point out other options. It is not legal advice, which I am not at all qualified to dispense.</p>

<p>Most conference talks are transactional. The speaker has a point to
make. After the presentation, it's "over"; only spoken about in
perfect tenses. You've communicated your thoughts, perhaps had a
conversation or two, but, mostly, moved on.</p>
<p>I've given talks like these. However, about two years ago, I gave a
talk that had a deep impact on my life. That talk was Crypto 101.</p>
<p>Right before the presentation, cryptanalytic research was released
that popped RC4. I couldn't have asked for a better setup. Turns out
it wasn't <em>just</em> luck; eventually our systemic failure as an industry
in taking security seriously was bound to catch up with us. Since
then, the proverbial piper has been well-paid. We've seen a plethora
of serious security bugs. Huge corporations have been the victims of
attacks in the billions of dollars a pop. As I'm writing this blog
post, there's an article on a new TLS attack in my reading list.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear that this wasn't just a one-off thing. I
started writing <a href="http://crypto101.github.io">Crypto 101, the book,</a> not too long after
giving the talk. We were, unwittingly, at the crest of a wave that's
still growing. Projects like PyCA and LibreSSL started fighting
tirelessly to make the software we use better. Security talks became a
mandatory part of the programming conference food pyramid. My friends
Hynek and Ying gave fantastic talks. They, too, got "lucky" with a
security bombshell: Heartbleed happened mere days before the
conference.</p>
<p>Last week, I presented Crypto 101 again at rax.io, Rackspace's
internal conference. It was well-received, and I think I provided
value for people's time. One thing, more than anything, it
crystallized where we are. We're not done yet. There's still a huge
audience left to reach. Interest in information security has done
nothing but grow.  With a total of just over 100,000 downloads for the
book and about half as many for the recording of the presentation,
people are definitely listening. We've made real impact, and we have
people's attention, but we need to keep going.</p>
<p>One of the two talks I'll be giving at PyCon is a more high-level
overview of how we can build secure systems. More friends of mine will
talk in about TLS there too. Within Rackspace, I'm focusing on
information security. There are awesome things brewing here, and I
hope that we can continue the great work we've been doing so far.</p>
<p>We've accomplished a lot, but we're just getting started.</p>

I am cycling my GPG key.

My old key has fingerprint:

D9DC 4315 772F 8E91 DD22 B153 DFD1 3DF7 A8DD 569B

My new key has fingerprint:

45DC 13EB 6A01 21E8 5219 8C09 8763 869B E2B2 663E

(If you're looking for the key ID, that's the last 8 hex characters of
the fingerprint.)

While my new key may superficially seem less secure, since I have gone
from a 4096 bit RSA key to a 3072 bit one, the new one has the
wonderful advantage of living on a smart card.

I have no reason to presume my old key to be compromised.  I have
changed the expiration date of my old key to March 7th of this year. I
have signed the new key with the old one.

I am in the process of updating https://keybase.io/lvh.

<p>Imagine that you had a capability URL, except instead of giving you
the ability to perform a specific <em>action</em>, it gave you the ability to
perform a (limited) set of operations on a third party API,
e.g. OpenStack. The capability URL wouldn't just be something you
exercise or revoke; it'd be an API endpoint, mostly indistinguishable
from the real API. Incoming requests would be inspected, and based on
a set of rules, either be rejected or forwarded to the API being
shimmed.</p>
<h2>Proof of concept</h2>
<p>At my day job, we had a programming task that I thought logic
programming would be well-suited for. Unfortunately, logic programming
is kind of weird and esoteric. Even programmers with otherwise broad
experiences professed to not being quite sure how it worked, or what
to do with it.</p>
<p>Therefore, I used up my hack day (a day where we get to hack on random
projects) to cook up some cool stuff using logic programming. I demoed
the usual suspects (<a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/blob/master/src/shimmer/monkey.clj">the monkey with the banana</a>, and a
<a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/blob/master/src/shimmer/sudoku.clj">sudoku solver</a>), illustrating the difference between the
relational nature of the logic programs and the imperative nature of
the algorithms you might otherwise write to solve the same problems.
Finally, I demoed the aforementioned proxying API shim. The proof of
concept, codenamed shimmer, is <a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/">up on Github</a>.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the handler function, which takes incoming
requests and modifies them slightly so they can be passed on:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">build-handler</span>

<p>(Those <code>spy</code> calls are from the excellent <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre"><code>timbre</code></a>
library. They make it easy to log values without cluttering up your
code; a godsend while developing with some libraries you're not
terribly familiar with.)</p>
<p>The matching function looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">match</span>

<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>Make this thing actually vaguely correct. That means e.g. also
inspecting the body for URL references, and changing those to go
through the proxy as well.</p>
<p>Start collecting a library of short hand notations for specific API
functionality, e.g. if you're proxying an OpenStack API, you should be
able to just say you want to allow server creation requests, without
having to figure out exactly what those requests look like.</p>
<p>The spec is hard-coded, it should be specified at runtime. That was
trickier than I had originally anticipated: the vast majority of
<code>core.logic</code> behavior uses macros. While some functionality is fairly
easy to port, that's probably a red herring: I don't want to port a
gazillion macros. As an example, here's <code>conds</code>, which is just<code>conde</code>
as a function (except without support for logical conjunction per
disjunctive set of goals):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="o">^</span><span class="ss">:private</span> <span class="nv">conds</span>
  <span class="s">"Like conde, but a function."</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">goals</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">empty?</span> <span class="nv">goals</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nv">l/fail</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">l/conde</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nb">first </span><span class="nv">goals</span><span class="p">)]</span>
             <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nf">conds</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">rest </span><span class="nv">goals</span><span class="p">))])))</span>
</pre>


<p>That's not the worst function, but let's just say I see a lot of
<code>macroexpand</code> in my future if I'm going to take this seriously.</p>
<p>URLs and bodies should be parsed, so that you can write assertions
against structured data, or against URL patterns, instead of specific
URLs.</p>
<p>If I ever end up letting any of this be a serious part of my day job,
I'm going to invest a ton of time improving the documentation for both
<code>core.logic</code> and <code>core.typed</code>. They're <em>fantastic</em> projects, but
they're harder to get started with than they could be, and that's a
shame.</p>

<p>(Title with apologies to Glyph.)</p>
<p>Recently, some friends of mine suggested that "software engineer" is
not a good job title. While they are of course free to call their
profession whatever they like, I respectfully disagree: I think
"engineer" is a perfectly cromulent description of what we do.</p>
<p>This is an opinion piece. Despite arriving at opposite conclusions,
the disagreement is feathery at best.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-if-buildings-failed-as-often-as-software-projects">
<h2>What if buildings failed as often as software projects?</h2>
<p>To illustrate the differences between software development and other
engineering disciplines, Glyph compares software to civil engineering.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to getting things done, we're just not very
good:</p>
<blockquote>
Most software projects fail; as of 2009, 44% are late, over budget,
or out of specification, and an additional 24% are canceled
entirely. Only a third of projects succeed according to those
criteria of being under budget, within specification, and complete.</blockquote>
<p>Such shenanigans would never be accepted in a Serious Engineering
Discipline, like civil engineering:</p>
<blockquote>
Would you want to live in a city where almost a quarter of all the
buildings were simply abandoned half-constructed, or fell down
during construction? Where almost half of the buildings were missing
floors, had rents in the millions of dollars, or both?</blockquote>
<p>I certainly wouldn't.</p>
<p>Computers are terrible, but not quite <em>that</em> bad, as Glyph points
out. "Failure" simply means something different for software projects
than it does for construction projects. Many of those "failed"
software projects were quite successful by other measures; the problem
isn't with software projects, it's with applying civil engineering
standards to a project that isn't.</p>
<p>Software projects aren't civil engineering projects.  Attempts to
treat them as such have done much more harm than good. That said, that
doesn't mean that software development isn't engineering.</p>
<p>Firstly, civil engineering is the outlier here. Other engineering
disciplines don't do well according to the civil engineering success
yardstick either. The few engineering endeavors that do are usually
civil engineering in disguise, such as the construction of nuclear and
chemical plants.  Rank-and-file projects in most fields of engineering
operate a lot more like a software project than the construction of a
skyscraper. Projects are late and over budget, often highly
experimental in nature, and in many cases also subject to changing
requirements. It's true that we just can't plan ahead in software, but
we're not the only ones.</p>
<p>Secondly, we may be confounding cause and effect, even if we overlook
that not all engineering is civil engineering. Are software projects
unable to stick to these standards because it's not engineering, or is
civil engineering the only thing that sticks to them because <em>they
have no other choice</em>? Conversely, do we fail early and often because
we're not engineering, or because, unlike civil engineering projects,
we <em>can</em>? <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/reverse-ungineering.html#anthropic" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Finally, software has existed for decades, but buildings have for
millennia. Bridges used to collapse all the time. Tacoma Narrows
wasn't so long ago. If the tour guide on my trip to Paris is to be
believed, one of those bridges has collapsed four times already.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-this-isn-t-science">
<h2>But this isn't science!</h2>
<p>Supposedly, software engineering isn't "real" engineering because,
unlike "real" engineering, it is not backed by "real" science or math.
This statement is usually paired with a dictionary definition of the
word "engineering".</p>
<p>I feel this characterization is incongruent with the daily reality of
engineering.</p>
<p>Consider the civil engineer, presumably the engineeringest engineer
there is. <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/reverse-ungineering.html#civil" id="id2">[2]</a> If you ask me to dimension an I-beam for
you, I would:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>spitball the load,</li>
<li>draw a free-body diagram,</li>
<li>probably draw a shear and moment diagram,</li>
<li>and pick the smallest standard beam that'll do what you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to know how far that beam is going to go, I'll draw you
some conjugate beams. I would also definitely <em>not</em> use the
moment-area theorem, even though it wouldn't be too difficult for the
reasonable uses of an I-beam.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, someone inflicted a variety of theories on me.
Euler-Bernouilli beam theory, for example. Very heavy textbooks with
very heavy math. Neither my physical therapist nor my regular one
expect me to ever <em>truly</em> recover. Nonetheless, area moments and
section moduli are the only way to understand where the <tt class="docutils literal">I</tt> in
I-beam comes from.</p>
<p>Nasty math didn't prevent me from dimensioning that I-beam. And I do
really mean <em>math</em>, not physics: Euler-Bernouilli is a math hack. You
get it by taking Hooke's law and throwing some calculus at it. Hooke's
law itself is more math than physics, too: it's a first-order
approximation based only on the observation that stuff stretches when
you pull it. It's wrong all the time, even for fairly germane objects
like rubber bands. Both theories were put together long before we had
materials science. We use them because they (mostly) work, not because
they are a consequence of a physical model.</p>
<p>That was just one example from a single discipline, but it holds more
generally, too. I analyze circuits by recognizing subsections. If you
show me a piece that looks like a low-pass filter, I am not distracted
by Maxwell's equations to figure out what that little capacitor is
doing.  I could certainly derive its behavior that way; in fact,
someone made me do that once, and it was quite instructive. But I'm
not bothered with the electrodynamics of a capacitor right now; I'm
just trying to understand this circuit!</p>
<p>This isn't just how engineers happen to do their jobs in practice,
either. Engineering breakthroughs live on both sides of science's
cutting edge. When Shockley et al. first managed to get a transistor
to work, we didn't really understand what was going on. <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/reverse-ungineering.html#tor" id="id3">[3]</a> Carnot
was building engines long before anyone realized he had stumbled upon
one of the most fundamental properties of the universe. Nobody was
doing metaphysics. Sadi wanted a better steam engine.</p>
<p>To me, saying that I-beam was dimensioned with the help of beam theory
is about as far from the truth as saying that a software project was
built with the help of category theory. I'm sure that there's some way
that that thing I just wrote is a covariant functor and you can
co-Yoneda your way to proving natural isomorphism, but I don't <em>have</em>
to care in order to successfully produce some software. It's easy to
reduce an applied field to <em>just</em> the application of that field, but
that doesn't make it so; especially if we haven't even really figured
out the field yet.</p>
<p>So, even if the math and science behind computer engineering is
somehow less real than that other math and science, I think that
difference is immaterial, and certainly not enough to make us an
entirely different profession.</p>

<div class="section" id="but-that-isn-t-art">
<h2>But <em>that</em> isn't art!</h2>
<p>Many people smarter than I have made the argument that programming is
art, not dissimilar from painting, music or even cooking. I'm
inclined to agree: many talented programmers are also very talented
artists in other fields. However, I do disagree that those things are
art-like <em>unlike</em> engineering, which is supposedly just cold, hard
science.</p>
<p>There's a not-so-old adage that science is everything we understand
well enough to explain to a computer, and art is everything else. If
that's true, there's definitely plenty of art to be found in
engineering. (That was a little tongue-in-cheek. Nobody wants to get
dragged into a semantic argument about what art <em>is</em>.)</p>
<p>Even with a much narrower view of art, engineers do plenty of it, as
I've tried to argue before. Not all engineering calls are direct
consequences of relativity, thermodynamics or quantum
mechanics. Sometimes, it is really just down to what the engineer
finds most palatable. Even civil engineers, the gray predictable
stalwarts of our story, care about making beautiful things. The Burj
Khalifa wasn't a consequence of a human following an algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think the similarities run deep. I hope we don't throw that away
essentially just because our field is a little younger. We're all
hackers here; and we're all engineers, too.</p>

<p>Most classic turn-based games, from chess all the way to Civilization
V, are sequential in nature. A player makes a move, then the next
player makes a move, and so on. The details can vary, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There could be two players, or multiple. This number is tightly
bound for scaling reasons, which we'll discuss later.</li>
<li>The game could have perfect information, like chess, where all
players see a move as soon as it is played. The game could also have
imperfect information, like Civilization V, where players see part
of a move, but the effets may be obscured by fog of war.</li>
<li>The players may play in a consistent order (chess, Civilization V),
or in a somewhat random one (D&amp;D's initiative system).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those things are more or less orthogonal to the turn system.
Players play turns sequentially, so I'm going to call these
<em>sequential turn-based games</em>.</p>
<p>Sequential turns make scaling the number of players up difficult. Even
with only 8 players, any given player will spend most of their time
waiting. While 8 players are a lot for most turn-based games, it's
nothing compared to an MMORPG.</p>
<p>An alternative to <em>sequential</em> turn-based play is <em>simultaneous</em>
turn-based play. In simultaneous turn-based play all players issue
their moves at the same time, and all moves are played out at the same
time. The simplest example is rock-paper-scissors, but Diplomacy works
the same way. More recently, this system has been explored by the
top-down tactical game <a class="reference external" href="http://www.frozensynapse.com/">Frozen Synapse</a>.</p>
<p>While simultaneous turn-based play gets us closer to making massively
multiplayer turn-based games feasible by turning a linear scaling
problem into a constant time one, we're not quite out of the woods
yet.</p>
<p>Consider what happens when a player does not make a move. There are a
few reasons that might happen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The player is not playing the game right now.</li>
<li>The player has stopped playing the game altogether.</li>
<li>The player may be in a hopeless position, where stalling is better
than losing. (Stalling may tie up lots of enemy resources.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've ever gotten frustrated at a multiplayer game that has a
"ready" system before you begin a game, but had to wait because one of
the players disappeared; this is essentially the problem turn-based
games face <em>every turn</em>.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to mitigate this problem. Games can
duplicate playing fields. That works for both sequential games like
Hero Academy and simultaneous ones like Frozen Synapse. If a player
doesn't make a move, that particular instance of the game world
doesn't go anywhere; but you can play any number of games
simultaneously.</p>
<p>For this strategy to work, the playing fields have to be independent.
You don't lose heroes or soldiers because they're stuck on some stale
game. The worst possible outcome is that your game statistics don't
reflect reality.</p>
<p>That works, but rules out a permanent game world with shared
resources. If there's a larger story being told, you would want these
worlds to be linked somehow: be it through shared resources, or
because they're literally the same game world.</p>
<p>There's a number of creative ways to get out from under that problem,
usually by involving wall-clock time. For example, if a player doesn't
respond within a fixed amount of time, they may forfeit their turn.
Fuel consumption might be based on wall-clock time, not turns. <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/on-multiplayer-turn-based-game-mechanics.html#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>
There's a lot of degrees of freedom here. Do you use a global clock,
or one local to a particular area?</p>
<p>A global clock is probably simpler, but poses some game play
challenges. How long is the tick? Too fast, and a player may see their
empire annihilated while they're sleeping. Too slow, and the most
trivial action takes forever. There isn't necessarily one right
answer, either. In an all-out cataclysmic struggle between two
superpowers, a complete tactical battle plan may take a long time. Any
timescale that isn't frustratingly short for that situation will be
frustratingly long for anyone trying to guide their spaceship (or
kodo, depending which universe you're in) across the Barrens.</p>
<p>Local clocks have their own share of difficulties. You still need to
answer what happens for anything that isn't in a particular battle;
you still need to answer what happens when battles merge or diverge.</p>
<p>I'm currently exploring the shared global clock. In order to mitigate
the issues I described, I'm contemplating two ideas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Allow programmable units; a la Screeps, CodeWars...</li>
<li>Allow players to plan several turns ahead of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are, of course, not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>I'm considering renaming the project to its plural, hypercathexes,
because then it can be about a hyper cat in a bunch of hexes.</p>
<p>The only real constraints I started with was that I wanted a
simultaneous turn-based space game on a hex grid.</p>
<p>Amit Patel from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redblobgames.com">Red Blob Games</a> has basically the awesomest page
about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">hex grids</a>, and a ton of awesome pages about many other areas
of game development. I think it's a fantastic resource for programmers
like myself who don't do game dev as a day job, but just want to make
a little game on the side.</p>
<p>Simultaneous turn-based means that all players plan their moves
simultaneously, and they are then also executed simultaneously. This
has an interesting scaling effect. On the one hand, it clearly scales
better to many players, because players "play" simultaneously. On the
other hand, you start getting interesting problems. For example, clock
synchronization. Does the entire world advance with the same tick-tock
pattern? What happens when a player does <em>not</em> make a move within the
allotted time? If you allow different clocks in the world, does time
advance faster if both players submit a move, or do you always wait
until the maximum timeout?</p>
<p>I wanted an excuse to play with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a> and found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/plexus/chestnut">Chestnut</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lvh/hypercathexis/tree/d454da2b1d8c1cf491fc3cd7dba83ee1b2bd4c76">first version</a> had a working hex grid, but displayed it using
offset coordinates. I wanted to work using axial coordinates as much
as possible, because it makes a lot of math so much easier. Axial
coordinates work together with the "grain" of the hex map:</p>
<object data="img/AxialBaseVectors.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
axial base vectors</object>
<p>Second thing I did was move from individual <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tags produced by
Om to a single <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;svg&gt;</tt> with hexes (<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;polygon&gt;</tt>) inside it. This
fixed a number of annoying placement issues with CSS. CSS really wants
to position things based on bounding box, not midpoints. That's great
for web pages, not so much for my hex grid. I ran into a number of
annoying issues where certain hex borders would be wider than others.
Browsers aren't made to draw hex grids based on left/right offsets, I
guess...</p>
<p>I started by expressing distances in the SVG in terms of the hex
width, which would become my unit. The height would then be
\(\sqrt{3}/2\). Then, I realized that I could make my life easier by
expressing all x coordinates in terms of a single hex width, and all y
coordinates in terms of a single hex height; then I could just scale
differently across x and y at the end.</p>
<img alt="Simple SVG hex grid" src="img/BasicSVGHexGrid.png"><p>Developing in Firefox was mostly painless, but I discovered many
discrepancies once trying it in Chrome. Things that should be the same
aren't, particularly when it comes to transforms. For example, Chrome
would occasionally literally do the inverse of the scaling it was
supposed to:</p>
<img alt="Differences in scaling behavior across browsers" src="img/HexGridCrossBrowserScalingIssues.png"><p>I guess trying to implement things in browsers was a mistake.</p>

<p>It's no secret that I love Clojure. Like any tool though, it isn't
perfect. Today, I was trying to write unit tests that use
<tt class="docutils literal">clojure.core.async/timeout</tt>, so I wrote a test double analogous to
Twisted's <tt class="docutils literal">Clock</tt>. As I tried to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">with-redefs</span></tt> it in, I got the
most inscrutable error message out: <tt class="docutils literal">java.lang.ClassCastException:
icecap.handlers.delay_test$fake_timeout$timeout__22934 cannot be cast
to clojure.lang.IFn$LO</tt>.</p>
<p>Wha? I know <tt class="docutils literal">clojure.lang.IFn</tt>, Clojure's function type, but what
the heck is a <tt class="docutils literal">clojure.lang.IFn$LO</tt>?</p>
<p>Searching for the term didn't give any particularly useful results. It
was clear this happened when I was redeffing the original <tt class="docutils literal">timeout</tt>,
so I looked at its documentation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
clojure.core.async/timeout
([msecs])
Returns a channel that will close after msecs
</pre>
<p>Doesn't look too special to me. What's the type of that thing, anyway?
Let's find out:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (parents (type timeout))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$LO clojure.lang.AFunction}
</pre>
<p>Aha! So that is actually part of <tt class="docutils literal">timeout</tt>, not something else wonky
going on. What does the source say? It's a pretty lame shim:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(defn timeout
"Returns a channel that will close after msecs"
[^long msecs]
(timers/timeout msecs))
</pre>
<p>I mean, nothing interesting there, just a type hint.</p>
<p>Oh. Wait. That's not just a type hint. <tt class="docutils literal">long</tt> is a primitive.
Testing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (parents (type (fn [^long x] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$LO clojure.lang.AFunction}
</pre>
<p>Aha! Due to a JVM quirk, functions with a primitive type hint are
special. That works for doubles, too:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DO clojure.lang.AFunction}
</pre>
<p>And multiple arguments:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x ^double y] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DDO clojure.lang.AFunction}
&gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x ^long y] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DLO clojure.lang.AFunction}
</pre>
<p>Adding a simple type hint to the function fixed it. Success!</p>
