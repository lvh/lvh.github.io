Hi! I'm Laurens, but most folks call me ``lvh``. I'm a Principal at `Latacora`_.
We build security practices for startups. I do work in information security,
cryptography and distributed systems. I also manage the Latacora-adjacent
venture fund, Lagomorphic Capital.

I'm a co-founder and current President of the `Clojurists Together Foundation`_,
the principal funder of the open source Clojure community. I'm also a Fellow of
the `Python Software Foundation`_.

Feel free to send me an e-mail at my `personal address`_ (``_@lvh.io``) or my
`work address`_ (``lvh@latacora.com``).
