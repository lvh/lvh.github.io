Hi! I'm ``lvh``, principal engineer at `Rackspace Managed Security`_, working
on information security (particularly cryptography) and distributed
systems. My beard solves discrete logs in fields of small characteristic.

I'm a Fellow of the `Python Software Foundation`_, and wear a number of hats
at PyCon_. These days, I mostly write Clojure. I'm a big fan of Haskell
and ML. I write C in anger, and am really looking forward to the day where
Rust means I will never have to do so again.

I'm not looking for a new team to be a part of, but I am *definitely* looking
for great people to be a part of my team. If working on customer-facing
security seems interesting to you, `contact me`_.
