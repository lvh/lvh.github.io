Hi! I'm ``lvh``. I'm a software engineer, doing information security
(particularly cryptography) and distributed systems at Rackspace_. My
beard solves discrete logs in fields of small characteristic.

I've been in a lot of places around the world, but these days I'm
probably in San Francisco, Austin, San Antonio, or Chicago.

I'm a Fellow of the `Python Software Foundation`_, and wear a number
of hats at PyCon_. Not surprisingly, that's a consequence of writing a
good deal of Python. These days, I mostly write Clojure. I'm a big fan
of Haskell and ML. I often have to write C in anger, and am really
looking forward to the day where Rust means I will never have to do so
again.

I'm not looking for a new team to be a part of, but I am *definitely*
looking for great people to be a part of my team.
