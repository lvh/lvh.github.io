Hi, I'm ``lvh``. I'm a Principal at `Latacora`_.  If you're interested in
building a security team for your startup, you should come talk to us. I do
work in information security (particularly cryptography) and distributed
systems.  Currently I spend most of my time working on SecOps tooling.

I'm a Fellow of the `Python Software Foundation`_, and wore a number of hats at
PyCon_. These days, I mostly write Clojure. I write C in anger, and am really
looking forward to the day where Rust means I will never have to do so again.

Feel free to send me an e-mail at my `personal address`_ (``_@lvh.io``) or my
`work address`_ (``lvh@latacora.com``).
