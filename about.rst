Hi! I'm Laurens, but most folks call me ``lvh``. I'm a Principal at `Latacora`_.
If you're interested in building a security team for your startup, you should
come talk to us. I do work in information security (particularly cryptography)
and distributed systems. My beard solves discrete logs in fields of small
characteristic.

I'm a Fellow of the `Python Software Foundation`_, and wear a number of hats at
PyCon_. These days, I mostly write Clojure. I'm a fan of Haskell and ML. I write
C in anger, and am really looking forward to the day where Rust means I will
never have to do so again.

Feel free to send me an e-mail at my `personal address`_ (``_@lvh.io``) or my
`work address`_ (``lvh@latacora.com``).
