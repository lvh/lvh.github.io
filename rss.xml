They
find one or more elements matching a CSS selector. I'm assuming basic
familiarity with CSS selectors: how you select elements, classes and ids. If
you haven't used them, start with the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors"&gt;MDN introduction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the following HTML page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"outside"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"inside"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lonely"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"outer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"inner"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;document.querySelectorAll("div")&lt;/code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;NodeList&lt;/code&gt; of all of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
elements on the page. &lt;code&gt;document.querySelector("div.lonely")&lt;/code&gt; returns that
single lonely div.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; supports both &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector"&gt;&lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll"&gt;&lt;code&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, letting you find elements in the entire
document. Elements themselves also support both &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector"&gt;&lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll"&gt;&lt;code&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, letting you query elements that are children of a
given element.  &lt;code&gt;document.querySelector("#my-id").querySelectorAll("img")&lt;/code&gt;
will find images that are children of &lt;code&gt;#my-id&lt;/code&gt;. In the sample HTML page above,
it will find &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img id="inside"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but not &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img id="outside"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, what do you think these two lines do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#my-id div div"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#my-id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"div div"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You might reasonably expect them to be equivalent. After all, one asks
&lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; elements inside &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; elements inside &lt;code&gt;#my-id&lt;/code&gt;, and the other
asks for &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; elements inside &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; elements that are &lt;em&gt;descendants&lt;/em&gt;
of &lt;code&gt;#my-id&lt;/code&gt;. However, when you look at &lt;a href="http://jsbin.com/hineco/edit?html,js,output"&gt;this JSbin&lt;/a&gt; you'll see
that they produce very different results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#my-id div div"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#my-id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"div div"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll"&gt;&lt;code&gt;element.querySelectorAll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn't match
elements starting from &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, it matches elements
matching the query that are also descendants of &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore,
we're seeing three &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; elements: &lt;code&gt;div.lonely&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;div.outer&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;div.inner&lt;/code&gt;. We're seeing them because they both match the &lt;code&gt;div div&lt;/code&gt;
selector and are all descendants of &lt;code&gt;#my-id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to remembering this is that CSS selectors are absolute; not
relative to any particular element, not even the element you're
calling &lt;code&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/code&gt; on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This even works with elements &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the element you're calling
&lt;code&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/code&gt; on. For example, this selector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#my-id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"div div div"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;... matches &lt;code&gt;div.inner&lt;/code&gt; in this snippet (&lt;a href="http://jsbin.com/woropuc/edit?html,js,output"&gt;JSbin&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"inner"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this API is surprising, and the front-end engineers I've asked
seem to agree with me. This is, however, not a bug; it's definitely
how the spec claims it should work, and how it works in Firefox,
Chrome and Safari. &lt;a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/thoughts-on-queryselectorall/"&gt;John Resig commented&lt;/a&gt; how he and others
felt this behavior was quite confusing back when the spec came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two suggested ways to get the other behavior: the &lt;code&gt;:scope&lt;/code&gt;
CSS pseudo-selector, and &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;queryAll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;:scope&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-selector matches against the current scope. The
name comes from the &lt;a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-style-scoped"&gt;CSS scoping&lt;/a&gt;, which limits the scope
of styles to part of the document. The element we're calling
&lt;code&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/code&gt; on also counts as a scope, so this expression only
matches &lt;code&gt;div.inner&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#my-id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;":scope div div"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%3Ascope#Browser_compatibility"&gt;browser support&lt;/a&gt; for scoped CSS and the
&lt;code&gt;:scope&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-selector is extremely limited. Only recent versions of
Firefox support it by default. Blink-based browsers like Chrome and
Opera require the well-hidden experimental features flag to be turned
on. Safari has a buggy implementation. Internet Explorer doesn't
support it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other alternative is &lt;code&gt;element.query&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;queryAll&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately,
it's even more obscure. It is not referenced on MDN or caniuse.com,
and is missing from the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-parentnode"&gt;current DOM4 working draft&lt;/a&gt;,
dated 18 June 2015. It was still present in
&lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-dom-20140204/#interface-parentnode"&gt;an older version of the same draft&lt;/a&gt;, dated 4 February
2014, as well as the &lt;a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-parentnode"&gt;WHATWG Living Document&lt;/a&gt; version of
the spec. It has also been implemented by at least two polyfills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://webreflection.github.io/dom4/"&gt;Dom4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/barberboy/dom-elements"&gt;dom-elements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>css</category><category>dom</category><category>webdev</category><guid>https://www.lvh.io/posts/queryselectorall-from-an-element-probably-doesnt-do-what-you-think-it-does.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2015 19:11:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Today's OpenSSL bug (for techies without infosec chops)</title><link>https://www.lvh.io/posts/todays-openssl-bug-for-techies-without-infosec-chops.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 1.0.1n+ and 1.0.2b+ had a new feature that allows finding an
alternative certificate chain when the first one fails. The logic in
that feature had a bug in it, such that it didn't properly verify if
the certificates in the alternative chain had the appropriate
permissions; specifically, it didn't check if those certificates are
certificate authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this means that an attacker who has a valid certificate
for any domain, can use that certificate to produce new
certificates. Those normally wouldn't work, but the algorithm for
finding the alternative trust chain doesn't check if the valid
certificate can act as a certificate authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's a certificate (chain)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certificate is a bit like an ID card: it has some information about
you (like your name), and is authenticated by a certificate authority
(in the case of an ID, usually your government).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's a certificate authority?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certificate authority is an entity that's allowed to authenticate
certificates. Your computer typically ships with the identity of those
certificate authorities, so it knows how to recognize certificates
authorized by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ID analogy, your computer knows how to recognize photo IDs
issued by e.g. California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is that in some cases, OpenSSL was willing to accept
signatures authenticated by certificates that don't have certificate
authority powers. In the analogy, it would mean that it accepted
CostCo cards as valid ID, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why did they say it wouldn't affect most users?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This basically means "we're assuming most users are using OpenSSL for
vanilla servers", which is probably true. Most servers do use OpenSSL,
and most clients (browsers) don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug affects anyone trying to authenticate their peer. That
includes regular clients, and servers doing client
authentication. Regular servers aren't affected, because they don't
authenticate their peer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servers doing client authentication are fairly rare. The biggest
concern is with clients. While browsers typically don't use OpenSSL, a
lot of API clients do. For those few people affected by the bug and
with clients that use OpenSSL, the bug is catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's client authentication?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of TLS connections only authenticate the
server. When the client opens the connection, the server sends its
certificate. The client checks the certificate chain against the list
of certificate authorities that it knows about. The client is
typically authenticated, but over the protocol spoken inside of TLS
(usually HTTP), not at a TLS level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn't the only way TLS can work. TLS also supports authenticating
clients with certificates, just like it authenticates servers. This is
called mutually authenticated TLS, because both peers authenticate
each other. At Rackspace Managed Security, we use this for all
communication between internal nodes. We also operate our own
certificate authority to sign all of those certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's TLS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLS is what SSL has been called for way over a decade. The old name
stuck (particularly in the name "OpenSSL"), but you should probably
stop using it when you're talking about the secure protocol, since all
of the versions of the protocol that were called "SSL" have crippling
security bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why wasn't this found by automated testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure. I wish automated testing this stuff was easier. Since
I'm both a user and a big fan of client authentication, which is a
pretty rare feature, I hope to spend more time in the future creating
easy-to-use automated testing tools for this kind of scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How big is the window?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.0.1n and 1.0.2b were both released on 11 Jun 2015. The fixes, 1.0.1p
and 1.0.2d, were released today, on 9 Jul 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "good news" is that the bad releases are recent. Most people who
have an affected version will be updating regularly, so the number of
people affected is small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug affected following platforms (non-exhaustive):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It did not affect stock OS X, because they still ship
  0.9.8. However, the bug does affect a stable version shipped through
  Homebrew (1.0.2c).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2015/CVE-2015-1793.html"&gt;Ubuntu is mostly not affected&lt;/a&gt;. The only affected version
  is the unreleased 15.10 (Wily). Ubuntu has already released an
  update for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bug affects stable releases of Fedora. I previously mistakenly
  reported that the contrary, but that information was based on their
  package version numbers, which did not match upstream. Fedora
  backported the faulty logic to their version of 1.0.1k, which was
  available in Fedora 21 and 22. They have since released patches; see
  &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1241544"&gt;this ticket&lt;/a&gt; for details. Thanks to Major Hayden for the
  correction!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bug does not affect Debian stable, but it does affect
  &lt;a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1793s=openssl"&gt;testing and unstable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bug affects &lt;a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=-last_update"&gt;ArchLinux testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug is disastrous, but affects few people. If you're running
stable versions of your operating system, you're almost certainly
safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest concern is with software developers using OS X. That
audience uses HTTPS APIs frequently, and the clients to connect to
those APIs typically use OpenSSL. OS X comes with 0.9.8zf by default
now, which is a recent revision of an ancient branch. Therefore,
people have a strong motivation to get their OpenSSL from a
third-party source. The most popular source is Homebrew, which up
until earlier this morning shipped 1.0.2c. The bug affects that
version. If you installed OpenSSL through Homebrew, you should go
update right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>security</category><guid>https://www.lvh.io/posts/todays-openssl-bug-for-techies-without-infosec-chops.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2015 15:26:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>They do take security seriously</title><link>https://www.lvh.io/posts/they-do-take-security-seriously.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, I read an &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2015/07/we-take-security-seriously-otherwise.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the plethora of
information security breaches in recent history. Its title reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We take security seriously”, otherwise known as “We didn’t take it
seriously enough”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then lists a number of companies informing the public that
they've been breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this article doesn't just blame the victims of those attacks,
but subjects them to public ridicule. Neither helps anyone, least of
all end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised to hear such comments from Troy Hunt. He's certainly an
accomplished professional with extensive security experience. This is
not the first time people have expressed similar thoughts; the
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9834099"&gt;HN thread&lt;/a&gt; for that article is rife with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explicit assumption is that these companies wouldn't have gotten
in trouble if only they had taken security more seriously. In a world
where the information services store is increasingly valuable and
software increasingly complex, breaches are going to happen. The idea
that getting breached is their own darn fault is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is also counterproductive. Firstly, there's one thing all of
the victims being ostracized have in common: they disclosed the
details of the breach. That is exactly what they should have done;
punishing them creates a perverse incentive for victims to hide
breaches in the future, a decidedly worse end-user outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if any breach is as bad as any other breach, there is no
incentive to proactively mitigate damage from future breaches by
hardening internal systems. Why encrypt records, invest in access
control or keep sensitive information in a separate database with
extensive audit logging? It might materially impact end-user security,
but who cares -- all anyone is going to remember is that you got
popped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's a subtle PR issue: how can the security industry
build deep relationships with clients when we publicly ridicule them
when the inevitable happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These commentators have presumably not been the victims of a breach
themselves. I have trouble swallowing that anyone who's been through
the terrifying experience of being breached, seeing a breach up close
or even just witnessing a hairy situation being defused could air
those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't been the victim of an attack, and feel that your
security posture is keeping you from becoming one, consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's your threat model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How confident are you in your estimation of the capabilities of
   attackers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you still be okay if your database became three orders of
   magnitude more valuable? Most personal data's value will scale
   linearly with the number of people affected, so if you're a small
   start-up with growth prospects, you'll either fail to execute, or
   be subject to that scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you still be okay if the attacker has a few 0-days?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the adversary is a nation-state?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; you haven't been breached?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings me to my final thesis: I contest the claim that all of the
companies in the article didn't take security seriously. It is far
more probable that all of the companies cited in the article have
expended massive efforts to protect themselves, and, in doing so,
foiled many attacks. It's also possible that they haven't; but the
onus there is certainly on the accuser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, that's a weak form of disagreement, since "taking something
seriously" is entirely subjective. However, keep in mind that many
targets &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; haven't taken security seriously, and would not
even have the technical sophistication to detect an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(By the way, if you too would like to help materially improve people's
security, we're hiring.

server. When the client opens the connection, the server sends its
certificate. The client checks the certificate against the list of
certificate authorities that it knows about. The client is typically
authenticated, but over the inner HTTP connection, not at a TLS level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn't the only way TLS can work. TLS also supports authenticating
clients with certificates, just like it authenticates servers. This is
called mutually authenticated TLS, because both peers authenticate
each other. At Rackspace Managed Security, we use this for all
communication between internal nodes. We also operate our own
certificate authority to sign all of those certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major library, &lt;a href="https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit"&gt;&lt;code&gt;http-kit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, makes use of Java's
&lt;code&gt;javax.net.ssl&lt;/code&gt;, notably &lt;code&gt;SSLContext&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;. These Java APIs
are exhaustive, and very... Java. While it's easy to make fun of these
APIs, most other development environments leave you using OpenSSL,
whose APIs are patently misanthropic. While some of these APIs do
leave something to be desired, &lt;a href="https://aphyr.com/"&gt;aphyr&lt;/a&gt; has done a lot of the
hard work of making them more palatable with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/aphyr/less-awful-ssl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;less-awful-ssl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That gives you an
&lt;code&gt;SSLContext&lt;/code&gt;. Request methods in &lt;code&gt;http-kit&lt;/code&gt; have an &lt;code&gt;opts&lt;/code&gt; map that
you can pass a &lt;code&gt;:sslengine&lt;/code&gt; object to. Given an &lt;code&gt;SSLContext&lt;/code&gt;, you just
need to do &lt;code&gt;(.createSSLEngine ctx)&lt;/code&gt; to get the engine object you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major library, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http"&gt;&lt;code&gt;clj-http&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, uses lower-level
APIs. Specifically, it requires [&lt;code&gt;KeyStore&lt;/code&gt;][keystore] instances for
its &lt;code&gt;:key-store&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:trust-store&lt;/code&gt; options. That requires diving deep
into Java's cryptographic APIs, which, as mentioned before, might be
something you want to avoid. While &lt;code&gt;clj-http&lt;/code&gt; is probably the most
popular library, if you want to do fancy TLS tricks, you probably want
to use &lt;code&gt;http-kit&lt;/code&gt; instead for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite HTTP library is &lt;a href="http://aleph.io/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aleph&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a href="http://ideolalia.com/"&gt;Zach Tellman&lt;/a&gt;.  It uses Netty instead of the usual Java IO
components. Fortunately, Netty's API is at least marginally friendlier
than the one in &lt;code&gt;javax.net.ssl&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately, there's no
&lt;code&gt;less-awful-ssl&lt;/code&gt; for Aleph. Plus, since I'm using &lt;a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sente&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for
asynchronous client-server communication, which doesn't have support
for &lt;code&gt;aleph&lt;/code&gt; yet. So, I'm comfortably stuck with &lt;code&gt;http-kit&lt;/code&gt; for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, API design &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; UX design. The library that "won" for
us was simply the one that was easiest to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a deeper dive in how TLS and its building blocks work, you should
watch my talk, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rmCGsCYJF8"&gt;Crypto 101&lt;/a&gt;, or the matching &lt;a href="https://www.crypto101.io"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. It's
free! Oh, and if you're looking for information security positions
(that includes entry-level!) in an inclusive and friendly environment

PL. Hence, I'm preparing to freshen up my arsenal of talks for the
coming year. The organizers have very generously given me a lot of
freedom regarding what to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to do more security talks as well as shift focus towards a
more technical audience, going more in-depth and touching on more
advanced topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Candidates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Object-capability systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capabilities are a better way of thinking about authorization. A
capability ("cap") gives you the authority to perform some action,
without giving you any other authority. Unlike role-based access
control systems, capability based systems nearly always fail-closed;
if you don't have the capability, you simply don't have enough
information to perform an action. Contrast this with RBAC systems,
where authorization constraints are enforced with pinky swears, and
therefore often subverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I can make an interesting case for capability systems to any
technical audience with some professional experience. Just talk about
secret management, and how it's nearly always terrifying! This gives
me an opportunity to talk about &lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/icecap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;icecap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/icecap/wiki/Introduction"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer"&gt;&lt;code&gt;shimmer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.lvh.io/posts/securing-apis-with-shims.html"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;,
my favorite pastimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Putting a backdoor in &lt;code&gt;RDRAND&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="https://www.lvh.io/posts/2013/10/thoughts-on-rdrand-in-linux.html"&gt;blogged about this before&lt;/a&gt; before, but I think I
could turn it into a talk. The short version is that Linux's PRNG
mixes in entropy from the &lt;code&gt;RDRAND&lt;/code&gt; in a way that would allow a
malicious implementation to control the output of the PRNG in ways
that would be indistinguishable to a (motivated) observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a proof of concept, I'd love to demo the attack, either in software
(for example, with QEMU) or even in hardware with an open core. I
could also go into the research that's been done regarding hiding
stuff on-die. Unfortunately, the naysayers so far have relied on
moving the goalposts continuously, so I'm not sure that would convince
them this is a real issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retroreflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opportunity to get in touch with my languishing inner electrical
engineer! It turns out that when you zap radio waves at most hardware,
the reflection gets modulated based on what it's doing right now. The
concept became known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_%28codename%29"&gt;TEMPEST&lt;/a&gt;, an NSA program. So far,
there's little public research on how feasible it is for your average
motivated hacker. This is essentially &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking"&gt;van Eck phreaking&lt;/a&gt;,
with 2015 tools. There's probably some interesting data to pick off of
USB HIDs, and undoubtedly a myriad of interesting devices controlled
by low-speed RS-232. Perhaps wireless JTAG debugging?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The unfinished draft bin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Underhanded curve selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another talk in the underhanded cryptography section I've considered
would be about underhanded elliptic curve selection. Unfortunately,
bringing the audience up to speed with the math to get something out
of it would be impossible in one talk slot. People already familiar
with the math are also almost certainly familiar with the argument for
rigid curves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web app authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks asked for a tutorial on how to authenticate to web
apps. I'm not sure I can turn that into a great talk. There's a lot of
general stuff that's reasonably obvious, and then there's highly
framework-specific stuff. I don't really see how I can provide a lot
of value for people's time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dreid"&gt;David Reid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DLitz"&gt;Dwayne Litzenberger&lt;/a&gt; made similar,
excellent points. They both recommend talking about object-capability
systems. Unlike the other two, it will (hopefully) actually help
people build secure software. Also, the other two will just make
people feel sad. I feel like those points generalize to all attack
talks; are they just not that useful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://www.lvh.io/posts/call-for-proposal-proposals.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2015 17:07:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Everything I've learned about running a financial aid program</title><link>https://www.lvh.io/posts/everything-ive-learned-about-running-a-financial-aid-program.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, I've been running PyCon's financial aid
program. Starting this year, the event coordinator has asked all staff
members to document what they do for PyCon. Firstly, this helps to
objectively recognize the hard work done by our (volunteer) staff, and
to help make sure there is continuity when the time comes to pass the
torch. Since organizers of other conferences have expressed interest
in my opinions for creating their own financial aid programs, I am
posting my notes publicly instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of hard-earned opinions, and is very much work in
progress. It's written as if it were a conversation with a
hypothetical financial aid organizer; so, whenever I say "you", I mean
you, the awesome person running financial aid at a conference
somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial aid programs are one of the most effective ways a software
foundation can spend their money. Even if you completely ignore the
effect it has on diversity, the number of speakers, sprinters and
other contributors that attended PyCon thanks to the financial aid
program is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Naming your program&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I inherited the term "Financial Aid". It's a fine term, but some other
conferences have come up with different terms that you may want to
consider, like "opportunity grants" and "diversity grants".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Taking care of yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a financial aid program is a lot of work. It scales linearly
with the number of applicants; it's your job to create a process that
keeps the work per applicant small, so that you can make the number of
applicants large. (You'll know you've succeeded when the fixed
overhead dominates, and it wouldn't really matter if you added another
dozen people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also an exercise in deferred gratification. Typically, you will
need to start preparing about a year before the conference. The
gratification part only comes at the conference itself. Since you'll
probably be quite busy as an organizer, it may only come after the
conference is over. You probably want to make sure that you have an
excellent social circle and that you're fairly self-motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Financial Aid Chair, I have been on the receiving end of verbal
abuse once. Don't put up with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat the drum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your financial aid program is useless if people don't know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some very talented speakers refrain from sending talk proposals
because they don't know if they can afford to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon's financial aid program is quite large. There are a number of
reasons for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCon's financial aid program has been around for many years, so
  it's quite mature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The program can count on support from PyCon leadership and the
  Python Software Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because PyCon US is the largest PyCon in the world, it acts as a
  nexus for people across the globe; therefore, it's important for the
  Python community that as many people as possible have a chance to
  attend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just to give you a ballpark idea of our numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what your numbers will be, expect that the primary
bottleneck of your financial aid program will simply be lack of funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Confusing parts and sad truths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No-shows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people will not show up, and not notify you (or notify you in
the days around the conference). Sometimes, there's good reasons
(illness, emergencies...). Sometimes, the reasons are less
great. Sometimes, you won't know the reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the Financial Aid Chair, no-shows are
terrible. It's a dead grant: money that's been allocated that can't
easily be translated into an extra attendee. Hence, many of the
suggestions I make for running financial aid processes are focused on
minimizing no-shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visas and travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many recipients have to cancel because they are unable to acquire
visas to Canada or the United States. In some cases, the visa process
took several months and simply did not complete in time for the
conference. In others the visas were declined for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occam's razor tells me that many countries, particularly the United
States, to some extent now Canada, but also Schengen zone countries
are simply actively hostile to foreigners visiting their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stand by your Chair&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, someone's responsible for making your
conference all it can be. That position is typically called the
Conference Chair. They get help from teams like the Program Committee
and Financial Aid to make that happen. At the end of the day they make
the hard calls, and you have to execute within their guidelines. That
typically includes the budget, but it also includes how you want to
allocate grants. You will almost certainly be resource-constrained, so
there are trade-offs to be made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to help newbies, or advanced programmers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to help marginalized groups? Which ones? How much?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want repeat attendees, or first timers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want a few people from all over the globe, or many locals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to benefit people who directly contribute to the
  conference? Which ones (speakers, staff...)? How much?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we care if people are receiving funds from other places? What if
  their employer is paying? What if their employer is also a sponsor?
  Does it make sense for them to give us &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; sponsorship fees when
  we're giving them a significant portion of that back in financial
  aid?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your budget is, unfortunately, zero sum. Every group you benefit means
less for everyone else. Helping everyone is the same as helping
no-one. Everyone wants to help everyone, but it's unlikely you'll get
to do that. Make everyone understands exactly what you want to
accomplish; you don't want to have this argument in the middle of
trying to run a financial aid process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Free or reduced-price tickets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many conferences, the tickets themselves can be quite
expensive. It makes sense to provide them to financial aid recipients
at no (or reduced) charge as part of their grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon previously provided free registration, but now provides
reduced-cost registration. This helps with no-shows, giving
applicants a financial incentive to let you know if they can't attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you document clearly that people will be receiving
tickets, at what price they'll be receiving them, and that their spots
are reserved. Common concerns from financial aid applicants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Your conference blog says that you're sold out, and I haven't
  received financial aid yet. Will I be able to attend?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I've already registered to reserve my spot; what do I do now that I
  get financial aid?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I'm a student. Will I still be able to register at the student rate
  if I apply for financial aid?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I applied for a larger amount because I didn't think ticket price
  would be included." (Unfortunately, most people tell you this far
  too late.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, clarity in communication is key here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous years, PyCon optionally provided free registration for people
who asked. This optional part was somewhat confusing. Whatever you do,
make it part of the default grant application. That also means that
you should probably offer the reduced-price ticket to anyone who
applies for financial aid, even if you can't otherwise give them a
grant. Otherwise, someone who applies for financial aid for whom you
simply don't have enough funds will get punished twice: no financial
aid, and no access to early bird ticket price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Housing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing, in the context of financial aid, means that you pay for a
bunch of hotel rooms for various dates at your conference, and then
put financial aid recipients in them. To save costs, you want to pair
them up, and you want to utilize the rooms maximally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think that it's a good idea to organize housing as part of
your travel grants. Those people are mistaken. Housing is a terrible
idea all round:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't scale, up or down. If you're small, you can't negotiate a
  worthwhile hotel block contract. If you're big, the system crashes
  under its /O(N²)/ weight (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not good for the financial aid recipients. While there are many
  nice things to be said about conference hotels, they are typically
  not economical. When we still organized housing, many financial aid
  recipients opted out: they could get significantly more bang for
  their buck otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not good for the conference. People leave, people join, people
  change dates, people have preferences (or hard constraints) about
  who they'll stay with... Doing this for any nontrivial number of
  people is a logistic nightmare; doing it for trivial number of
  people isn't worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having humans solve the allocation problem produces inefficiencies at
larger scales (i.e. humans typically come up with fairly suboptimal
solutions). It's a pretty tricky problem to solve even with computers
(believe me, I've &lt;a href="https://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/03/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid.html"&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/03/optimal-hotel-room-pairing.html"&gt;extensively&lt;/a&gt;), but computers
will never solve the logistic issues caused by human factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon used to manage housing for financial aid recipients. Getting rid
of this was the single best decision I've ever made for the financial
aid process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked out quite well for the attendees too. Providing simple tools
(i.e. the equivalent of a classifieds section) is more than ample to
help people find great groups to room-share with. This &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt;
opportunities for roomsharing, because it made it much less of a
hassle to mix-and-match between financial aid recipients and other
attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of FA people stayed in large AirBnBs or the like in groups of 6
or more, and ended up getting fantastic deals that allowed them to
stay an extra few days to attend other events like sprints and
tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Before the conference: from applications to allocation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep it simple. Use a form generator (Google Forms or Wufoo or
something) for data collection. All of the processing was done with
simple Python scripts, most of it in an IPython/Jupyter notebook. This
enables you to create well-documented processes, which helps
everyone. CSV files are your best friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make as many fields on the application form as possible directly
translatable to something in your allocation process. Multiple choice
and boolean values are your friend; the review process will make sure
the applications are accurate. Have free-form fields for documenting
things, but only use them in the review process. For example, you can
have a multiple choice field for Python expertise ranging from
beginner to expert, and then have a free-form field for applicants'
portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Names are weird. There are lots of falsehoods programmers believe
about names &lt;a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/"&gt;(link)&lt;/a&gt;. You probably want to ask for a legal
name; it's quite likely that you need to keep the legal name around
for your records. Ask a lawyer and/or an accountant for
details. However, you probably want to ask for an (optional) preferred
name as well, which you should always use when communicating with
them. There's a bunch of reasons those might be different, and people
may have excellent reasons for not using their legal names. For
example, a legal name might give someone away as being
transgender. Sometimes, you want to do that just for your /own/
convenience. People will put all sorts of stuff down as their "name",
but full legal names are quite consistent. This can be useful to match
up records from different sources, such as your registration database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of gender, asking for people's gender is also tricky. Make
sure you have at least a cursory understanding of how gender works
before you ask. Always have a "decline to answer" button, which is
distinct from "other/nonbinary". If all you really want to know is
whether someone qualifies for earmarked funds, just ask the specific
question you want to know; e.g. "Apply for a PyLadies grant (people
who self-identify as women only, please)".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual in programming, state is the bane of your existence. Keep it
in one place whenever possible. A (Google Drive) spreadsheet works
just fine. Your scripts should operate on data extracted from them
(again, CSV works fine), but not store any state. This is trickier
than it sounds, but the alternative is that you'll probably end up
destroying some data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews are easy to do in parallel, so get help from volunteers if
needed. Establish clear guidelines for what your discrete values
(e.g. Python experience) mean; not everyone agrees on what "expert"
means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Allocation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="https://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/03/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid.html"&gt;written about allocation before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon allocates approximately 15% over budget; i.e. the budget that we
allocate is 1.15x the actual grant budget. This does not include aid
in the form of e.g. reduced ticket prices; remember to account for
those separately!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon's no-show rate is somewhere between 10% and 20%, but it's very
hard to predict if the factors that contribute to that will affect
your conference equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in that previous blog post, you don't always want to
allocate the full grant asked for. People will still be able to attend
with partial grants but typically wouldn't with an empty
grant. Therefore it typically makes sense to reduce everyone's grant
slightly if that allows you to provide more grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up going with a fairly simple "flood fill" algorithm. An
applicant's score maps to a fraction of the budget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$f_i = \frac{s_i}{\sum_j s_j}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where \(f_i\) is the fraction of the budget you're willing to assign
to applicant \(i\), \(s_i\) is an applicant's score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If \(f_i \ge q \cdot r_i\) (where \(q\) is the fraction of the
grant you're willing to allocate and \(r_i\) is what the applicant
requested, you grant them \(q \cdot r_i\); otherwise, grant them 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some applicants will be below this fraction, some will be above. They
could be below this fraction because they have a very high score
(e.g. they are a speaker), or because they're "low hanging fruit" and
not asking for very much money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that if you run the algorithm again, the fractions will be
bigger; the people that received allocations in the previous round
were allocated less than what would've been their "fair share". Rinse,
repeat until you're out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a central website where people can see their current status and
updates, both specific to the applicant and generic to the entire
process. Training people to expect information there will drastically
reduce the number of repetitive questions you get to answer by e-mail,
which will contribute enormously to your happiness. Therefore, if
people ask questions that are answered there; answer, be kind, but
point out where they could have gotten that information from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the things you will have to say will be generic points about
the process. Nonetheless, I have spent huge amounts of time answering
individual questions about that generic process, which got get quite
tedious. Hence, even a static page that doesn't show any information
specific to the applicant, but just explaining the process in detail
is extremely valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being up-front about how your process works is also great for
prospective applicants who wouldn't feel comfortable asking. This also
attracts speakers to submit talk proposals; many speakers would not
propose a talk because they know they can't afford to come without
financial aid. Therefore, it's important to communicate clearly if you
intend to support speakers, both through your financial aid
communication and your call for papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that fails, send e-mail. Once you're over a dozen or so
recipients, use &lt;a href="http://www.mailgun.com/"&gt;Mailgun&lt;/a&gt;. Emails
particularly automated from your personal email account is a good way
to get stuck in spam filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disbursement (giving out money)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, talk to your treasurer. Possibly talk to a lawyer,
too. It's quite possible, particularly if you're in the United States,
that giving out a bunch of money as a non-profit comes with some
fairly complex strings attached. For example, you probably have
certain standards in terms of what records you have to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a European, I found it somewhat comical to still see checks in
active use, but hey; it works. For many parts of the world (apparently
not the United States, though) wire transfers are how you send money
to people. PayPal seems to work better for larger, established
organizations that use it often. There is less of a problem with the
accounts or funds being frozen. It does actively restrict (or, perhaps
more accurately, enforces restrictions on) sending funds to certain
countries, including Brazil and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash works, but is hard to scale. With PyCon's budget of well over
$100,000.00, managing cash is clearly less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, be pragmatic. Do whatever your recipients can
accept. Be sure to ask ahead of time, as your financial aid programs
may prove to be successful in bringing people in from very different
countries, with very different cultures and very different means
available to them for accepting your grant. This is the case for
PyCon, but I consider that a superb problem to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank the following people in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ewa Jodlowska, for managing PyCon and being the love of my life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van Lindberg, for continuously inspiring me to serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diana Clarke, for Charing PyCon US in Montreal&lt;/li&gt;

I'll be presenting &lt;a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/342/"&gt;a talk on building secure systems&lt;/a&gt; at PyCon 2015 next month, and I hope to blog more about interesting bits of comprehensible security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a strong believer in the importance of threat models. A threat model is your idea of what you're protecting against. It may seem obvious that you can't effectively protect anything without knowing what you're protecting it from. Sadly, simply contemplating your threat model puts you ahead of the curve in today's software industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threat models often simply deal with how much effort you're willing to spend to prevent something from happening. In a world with finite resources, we have to make choices. Some models are unrealistic or prohibitively expensive to defend against. These questions aren't all strictly technical: perhaps some risk is adequately covered by insurance. Perhaps you have a legal or a compliance requirement to do something, even if the result is technically inferior. These questions are also not just about &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; you're going to do: different threat models can lead to mutually exclusive resolutions, each a clear security win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your smartphone. Our phones have a lot of important, private information; it makes sense to protect them. The iPhone 6 provides two options for the lock screen: a passcode and a fingerprint sensor. Passcodes have been around for about as long as smartphones have, while fingerprint sensors are new and exciting. It's clear that either of them is more secure than not protecting your phone at all. But which one is more secure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people instinctively feel the fingerprint sensor is the way to go. Biometric devices feel advanced; up until recently, they only existed in Hollywood. Fingerprints have their share of issues. It's impossible to pick a new key or have separate keys for separate capabilities; you're stuck with the keys you have. A fingerprint is like a password that you involuntarily leave on everything you touch. That said, turning a fingerprint into something that will unlock your iPhone is out of reach for most attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passcodes aren't perfect either. People generally pick poor codes: important dates and years are common, but typically not kept secret in other contexts. If you know someone's birthday, there's a decent chance you can unlock their phone. At least with a passcode, you have the option of picking a good one. Even if you do, a passcode provides little protection against shoulder surfing. Most people unlock their phone dozens of times per day, and spend most of that day in the presence of other people. A lot of those people could see your passcode inconspicuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two options. Neither is perfect. How do you pick one? To make an informed choice, you need to formalize your threat models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, under the Fifth Amendment, you don't have to divulge information that might incriminate you. I am not a lawyer, and courts have provided conflicting rulings, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Computer_passwords"&gt;but currently it appears that this includes computer passwords.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2014/10/police-can-require-cellphone-fingerprint-not-pass-code?wpisrc=nl-swbd&amp;amp;wpmm=1#"&gt;However, a court has ruled that a fingerprint doesn't count as secret information.&lt;/a&gt; If you can unlock your phone with your fingerprint, they can force you to unlock it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your threat models include people snooping, the fingerprint sensor is superior. If your threat model includes law enforcement, the passcode is superior. So, which do you pick? It depends on your threat model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is an illustration of how threat models can conflict. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; operational security advice; in which case I would point out other options. It is not legal advice, which I am not at all qualified to dispense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>security</category><guid>https://www.lvh.io/posts/conflicting-threat-models.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2015 16:56:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>We're just getting started</title><link>https://www.lvh.io/posts/were-just-getting-started.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most conference talks are transactional. The speaker has a point to
make. After the presentation, it's "over"; only spoken about in
perfect tenses. You've communicated your thoughts, perhaps had a
conversation or two, but, mostly, moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've given talks like these. However, about two years ago, I gave a
talk that had a deep impact on my life. That talk was Crypto 101.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before the presentation, cryptanalytic research was released
that popped RC4. I couldn't have asked for a better setup. Turns out
it wasn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; luck; eventually our systemic failure as an industry
in taking security seriously was bound to catch up with us. Since
then, the proverbial piper has been well-paid. We've seen a plethora
of serious security bugs. Huge corporations have been the victims of
attacks in the billions of dollars a pop. As I'm writing this blog
post, there's an article on a new TLS attack in my reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It quickly became clear that this wasn't just a one-off thing. I
started writing &lt;a href="http://crypto101.github.io"&gt;Crypto 101, the book,&lt;/a&gt; not too long after
giving the talk. We were, unwittingly, at the crest of a wave that's
still growing. Projects like PyCA and LibreSSL started fighting
tirelessly to make the software we use better. Security talks became a
mandatory part of the programming conference food pyramid. My friends
Hynek and Ying gave fantastic talks. They, too, got "lucky" with a
security bombshell: Heartbleed happened mere days before the
conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I presented Crypto 101 again at rax.io, Rackspace's
internal conference. It was well-received, and I think I provided
value for people's time. One thing, more than anything, it
crystallized where we are. We're not done yet. There's still a huge
audience left to reach. Interest in information security has done
nothing but grow.  With a total of just over 100,000 downloads for the
book and about half as many for the recording of the presentation,
people are definitely listening. We've made real impact, and we have
people's attention, but we need to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the two talks I'll be giving at PyCon is a more high-level
overview of how we can build secure systems. More friends of mine will
talk in about TLS there too. Within Rackspace, I'm focusing on
information security. There are awesome things brewing here, and I
hope that we can continue the great work we've been doing so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've accomplished a lot, but we're just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>crypto</category><category>security</category><guid>https://www.lvh.io/posts/were-just-getting-started.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2015 01:06:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Updated GPG key</title><link>https://www.lvh.io/posts/updated-gpg-key.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This message is also available &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/lvh/6adfe51aa42bb268a273"&gt;as a Gist&lt;/a&gt;.

Hash: SHA512

I am cycling my GPG key.

My old key has fingerprint:

D9DC 4315 772F 8E91 DD22 B153 DFD1 3DF7 A8DD 569B

My new key has fingerprint:

45DC 13EB 6A01 21E8 5219 8C09 8763 869B E2B2 663E

(If you're looking for the key ID, that's the last 8 hex characters of
the fingerprint.)

While my new key may superficially seem less secure, since I have gone
from a 4096 bit RSA key to a 3072 bit one, the new one has the
wonderful advantage of living on a smart card.

I have no reason to presume my old key to be compromised.  I have
changed the expiration date of my old key to March 7th of this year. I
have signed the new key with the old one.

I am in the process of updating https://keybase.io/lvh.

the ability to perform a specific &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;, it gave you the ability to
perform a (limited) set of operations on a third party API,
e.g. OpenStack. The capability URL wouldn't just be something you
exercise or revoke; it'd be an API endpoint, mostly indistinguishable
from the real API. Incoming requests would be inspected, and based on
a set of rules, either be rejected or forwarded to the API being
shimmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proof of concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my day job, we had a programming task that I thought logic
programming would be well-suited for. Unfortunately, logic programming
is kind of weird and esoteric. Even programmers with otherwise broad
experiences professed to not being quite sure how it worked, or what
to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I used up my hack day (a day where we get to hack on random
projects) to cook up some cool stuff using logic programming. I demoed
the usual suspects (&lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/blob/master/src/shimmer/monkey.clj"&gt;the monkey with the banana&lt;/a&gt;, and a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/blob/master/src/shimmer/sudoku.clj"&gt;sudoku solver&lt;/a&gt;), illustrating the difference between the
relational nature of the logic programs and the imperative nature of
the algorithms you might otherwise write to solve the same problems.
Finally, I demoed the aforementioned proxying API shim. The proof of
concept, codenamed shimmer, is &lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/"&gt;up on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the handler function, which takes incoming
requests and modifies them slightly so they can be passed on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;build-handler&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;target-host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;target-port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;fn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;incoming-request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;incoming-request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;modified-request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;incoming-request&lt;/span&gt;
                                 &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dissoc &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; hack&lt;/span&gt;
                                 &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;assoc &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;target-host&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;target-port&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:throw-exceptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;modified-request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;403&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Forbidden&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"content-type"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"text/plain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Doesn't match!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Those &lt;code&gt;spy&lt;/code&gt; calls are from the excellent &lt;a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre"&gt;&lt;code&gt;timbre&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
library. They make it easy to log values without cluttering up your
code; a godsend while developing with some libraries you're not
terribly familiar with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matching function looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Checks if the request is allowed."&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;not= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/conde&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/featurec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:request-method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})]&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/featurec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:request-method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:post&lt;/span&gt;
                             &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"x-some-header"&lt;/span&gt;
                                       &lt;span class="s"&gt;"the right header value"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}})]&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/featurec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:request-method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/featurec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"x-some-header"&lt;/span&gt;
                                       &lt;span class="s"&gt;"another right header value"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}})]))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Future work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make this thing actually vaguely correct. That means e.g. also
inspecting the body for URL references, and changing those to go
through the proxy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start collecting a library of short hand notations for specific API
functionality, e.g. if you're proxying an OpenStack API, you should be
able to just say you want to allow server creation requests, without
having to figure out exactly what those requests look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spec is hard-coded, it should be specified at runtime. That was
trickier than I had originally anticipated: the vast majority of
&lt;code&gt;core.logic&lt;/code&gt; behavior uses macros. While some functionality is fairly
easy to port, that's probably a red herring: I don't want to port a
gazillion macros. As an example, here's &lt;code&gt;conds&lt;/code&gt;, which is just&lt;code&gt;conde&lt;/code&gt;
as a function (except without support for logical conjunction per
disjunctive set of goals):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;conds&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Like conde, but a function."&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;empty?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;l/fail&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/conde&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;first &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;conds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;rest &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))])))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's not the worst function, but let's just say I see a lot of
&lt;code&gt;macroexpand&lt;/code&gt; in my future if I'm going to take this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs and bodies should be parsed, so that you can write assertions
against structured data, or against URL patterns, instead of specific
URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ever end up letting any of this be a serious part of my day job,
I'm going to invest a ton of time improving the documentation for both
&lt;code&gt;core.logic&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;core.typed&lt;/code&gt;. They're &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; projects, but
they're harder to get started with than they could be, and that's a
shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>crypto</category><category>security</category><guid>https://www.lvh.io/posts/securing-apis-with-shims.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 06:24:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
