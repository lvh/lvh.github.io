Hash: SHA512

I am cycling my GPG key.

My old key has fingerprint:

D9DC 4315 772F 8E91 DD22 B153 DFD1 3DF7 A8DD 569B

My new key has fingerprint:

45DC 13EB 6A01 21E8 5219 8C09 8763 869B E2B2 663E

(If you're looking for the key ID, that's the last 8 hex characters of
the fingerprint.)

While my new key may superficially seem less secure, since I have gone
from a 4096 bit RSA key to a 3072 bit one, the new one has the
wonderful advantage of living on a smart card.

I have no reason to presume my old key to be compromised.  I have
changed the expiration date of my old key to March 7th of this year. I
have signed the new key with the old one.

I am in the process of updating https://keybase.io/lvh.

the ability to perform a specific &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;, it gave you the ability to
perform a (limited) set of operations on a third party API,
e.g. OpenStack. The capability URL wouldn't just be something you
exercise or revoke; it'd be an API endpoint, mostly indistinguishable
from the real API. Incoming requests would be inspected, and based on
a set of rules, either be rejected or forwarded to the API being
shimmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proof of concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my day job, we had a programming task that I thought logic
programming would be well-suited for. Unfortunately, logic programming
is kind of weird and esoteric. Even programmers with otherwise broad
experiences professed to not being quite sure how it worked, or what
to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I used up my hack day (a day where we get to hack on random
projects) to cook up some cool stuff using logic programming. I demoed
the usual suspects (&lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/blob/master/src/shimmer/monkey.clj"&gt;the monkey with the banana&lt;/a&gt;, and a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/blob/master/src/shimmer/sudoku.clj"&gt;sudoku solver&lt;/a&gt;), illustrating the difference between the
relational nature of the logic programs and the imperative nature of
the algorithms you might otherwise write to solve the same problems.
Finally, I demoed the aforementioned proxying API shim. The proof of
concept, codenamed shimmer, is &lt;a href="https://github.com/lvh/shimmer/"&gt;up on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the handler function, which takes incoming
requests and modifies them slightly so they can be passed on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;build-handler&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;target-host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;target-port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;fn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;incoming-request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;incoming-request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;modified-request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;incoming-request&lt;/span&gt;
                                 &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dissoc &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; hack&lt;/span&gt;
                                 &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;assoc &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;target-host&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;target-port&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:throw-exceptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;modified-request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;403&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Forbidden&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"content-type"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"text/plain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Doesn't match!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Those &lt;code&gt;spy&lt;/code&gt; calls are from the excellent &lt;a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre"&gt;&lt;code&gt;timbre&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
library. They make it easy to log values without cluttering up your
code; a godsend while developing with some libraries you're not
terribly familiar with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matching function looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Checks if the request is allowed."&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;not= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/conde&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/featurec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:request-method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})]&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/featurec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:request-method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:post&lt;/span&gt;
                             &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"x-some-header"&lt;/span&gt;
                                       &lt;span class="s"&gt;"the right header value"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}})]&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/featurec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:request-method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/featurec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"x-some-header"&lt;/span&gt;
                                       &lt;span class="s"&gt;"another right header value"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}})]))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Future work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make this thing actually vaguely correct. That means e.g. also
inspecting the body for URL references, and changing those to go
through the proxy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start collecting a library of short hand notations for specific API
functionality, e.g. if you're proxying an OpenStack API, you should be
able to just say you want to allow server creation requests, without
having to figure out exactly what those requests look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spec is hard-coded, it should be specified at runtime. That was
trickier than I had originally anticipated: the vast majority of
&lt;code&gt;core.logic&lt;/code&gt; behavior uses macros. While some functionality is fairly
easy to port, that's probably a red herring: I don't want to port a
gazillion macros. As an example, here's &lt;code&gt;conds&lt;/code&gt;, which is just&lt;code&gt;conde&lt;/code&gt;
as a function (except without support for logical conjunction per
disjunctive set of goals):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;conds&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Like conde, but a function."&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;empty?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;l/fail&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;l/conde&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;first &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;conds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;rest &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))])))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's not the worst function, but let's just say I see a lot of
&lt;code&gt;macroexpand&lt;/code&gt; in my future if I'm going to take this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs and bodies should be parsed, so that you can write assertions
against structured data, or against URL patterns, instead of specific
URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ever end up letting any of this be a serious part of my day job,
I'm going to invest a ton of time improving the documentation for both
&lt;code&gt;core.logic&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;core.typed&lt;/code&gt;. They're &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; projects, but
they're harder to get started with than they could be, and that's a
shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>security crypto</category><guid>http://www.lvh.io/posts/securing-apis-with-shims.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 06:24:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Reverse ungineering</title><link>http://www.lvh.io/posts/reverse-ungineering.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Title with apologies to Glyph.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, some friends of mine suggested that "software engineer" is
not a good job title. While they are of course free to call their
profession whatever they like, I respectfully disagree: I think
"engineer" is a perfectly cromulent description of what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an opinion piece. Despite arriving at opposite conclusions,
the disagreement is feathery at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-if-buildings-failed-as-often-as-software-projects"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if buildings failed as often as software projects?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the differences between software development and other
engineering disciplines, Glyph compares software to civil engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when it comes to getting things done, we're just not very
good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most software projects fail; as of 2009, 44% are late, over budget,
or out of specification, and an additional 24% are canceled
entirely. Only a third of projects succeed according to those
criteria of being under budget, within specification, and complete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such shenanigans would never be accepted in a Serious Engineering
Discipline, like civil engineering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Would you want to live in a city where almost a quarter of all the
buildings were simply abandoned half-constructed, or fell down
during construction? Where almost half of the buildings were missing
floors, had rents in the millions of dollars, or both?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly wouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers are terrible, but not quite &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad, as Glyph points
out. "Failure" simply means something different for software projects
than it does for construction projects. Many of those "failed"
software projects were quite successful by other measures; the problem
isn't with software projects, it's with applying civil engineering
standards to a project that isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software projects aren't civil engineering projects.  Attempts to
treat them as such have done much more harm than good. That said, that
doesn't mean that software development isn't engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, civil engineering is the outlier here. Other engineering
disciplines don't do well according to the civil engineering success
yardstick either. The few engineering endeavors that do are usually
civil engineering in disguise, such as the construction of nuclear and
chemical plants.  Rank-and-file projects in most fields of engineering
operate a lot more like a software project than the construction of a
skyscraper. Projects are late and over budget, often highly
experimental in nature, and in many cases also subject to changing
requirements. It's true that we just can't plan ahead in software, but
we're not the only ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we may be confounding cause and effect, even if we overlook
that not all engineering is civil engineering. Are software projects
unable to stick to these standards because it's not engineering, or is
civil engineering the only thing that sticks to them because &lt;em&gt;they
have no other choice&lt;/em&gt;? Conversely, do we fail early and often because
we're not engineering, or because, unlike civil engineering projects,
we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.lvh.io/posts/reverse-ungineering.html#anthropic" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, software has existed for decades, but buildings have for
millennia. Bridges used to collapse all the time. Tacoma Narrows
wasn't so long ago. If the tour guide on my trip to Paris is to be
believed, one of those bridges has collapsed four times already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="but-this-isn-t-science"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But this isn't science!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly, software engineering isn't "real" engineering because,
unlike "real" engineering, it is not backed by "real" science or math.
This statement is usually paired with a dictionary definition of the
word "engineering".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel this characterization is incongruent with the daily reality of
engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the civil engineer, presumably the engineeringest engineer
there is. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.lvh.io/posts/reverse-ungineering.html#civil" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; If you ask me to dimension an I-beam for
you, I would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spitball the load,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draw a free-body diagram,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably draw a shear and moment diagram,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and pick the smallest standard beam that'll do what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know how far that beam is going to go, I'll draw you
some conjugate beams. I would also definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use the
moment-area theorem, even though it wouldn't be too difficult for the
reasonable uses of an I-beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, someone inflicted a variety of theories on me.
Euler-Bernouilli beam theory, for example. Very heavy textbooks with
very heavy math. Neither my physical therapist nor my regular one
expect me to ever &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; recover. Nonetheless, area moments and
section moduli are the only way to understand where the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;I&lt;/tt&gt; in
I-beam comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasty math didn't prevent me from dimensioning that I-beam. And I do
really mean &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt;, not physics: Euler-Bernouilli is a math hack. You
get it by taking Hooke's law and throwing some calculus at it. Hooke's
law itself is more math than physics, too: it's a first-order
approximation based only on the observation that stuff stretches when
you pull it. It's wrong all the time, even for fairly germane objects
like rubber bands. Both theories were put together long before we had
materials science. We use them because they (mostly) work, not because
they are a consequence of a physical model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was just one example from a single discipline, but it holds more
generally, too. I analyze circuits by recognizing subsections. If you
show me a piece that looks like a low-pass filter, I am not distracted
by Maxwell's equations to figure out what that little capacitor is
doing.  I could certainly derive its behavior that way; in fact,
someone made me do that once, and it was quite instructive. But I'm
not bothered with the electrodynamics of a capacitor right now; I'm
just trying to understand this circuit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just how engineers happen to do their jobs in practice,
either. Engineering breakthroughs live on both sides of science's
cutting edge. When Shockley et al. first managed to get a transistor
to work, we didn't really understand what was going on. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.lvh.io/posts/reverse-ungineering.html#tor" id="id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; Carnot
was building engines long before anyone realized he had stumbled upon
one of the most fundamental properties of the universe. Nobody was
doing metaphysics. Sadi wanted a better steam engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, saying that I-beam was dimensioned with the help of beam theory
is about as far from the truth as saying that a software project was
built with the help of category theory. I'm sure that there's some way
that that thing I just wrote is a covariant functor and you can
co-Yoneda your way to proving natural isomorphism, but I don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;
to care in order to successfully produce some software. It's easy to
reduce an applied field to &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the application of that field, but
that doesn't make it so; especially if we haven't even really figured
out the field yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even if the math and science behind computer engineering is
somehow less real than that other math and science, I think that
difference is immaterial, and certainly not enough to make us an
entirely different profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="but-that-isn-t-art"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; isn't art!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people smarter than I have made the argument that programming is
art, not dissimilar from painting, music or even cooking. I'm
inclined to agree: many talented programmers are also very talented
artists in other fields. However, I do disagree that those things are
art-like &lt;em&gt;unlike&lt;/em&gt; engineering, which is supposedly just cold, hard
science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a not-so-old adage that science is everything we understand
well enough to explain to a computer, and art is everything else. If
that's true, there's definitely plenty of art to be found in
engineering. (That was a little tongue-in-cheek. Nobody wants to get
dragged into a semantic argument about what art &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with a much narrower view of art, engineers do plenty of it, as
I've tried to argue before. Not all engineering calls are direct
consequences of relativity, thermodynamics or quantum
mechanics. Sometimes, it is really just down to what the engineer
finds most palatable. Even civil engineers, the gray predictable
stalwarts of our story, care about making beautiful things. The Burj
Khalifa wasn't a consequence of a human following an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the similarities run deep. I hope we don't throw that away
essentially just because our field is a little younger. We're all
hackers here; and we're all engineers, too.&lt;/p&gt;

of person who builds targets, as opposed to the military
engineer, who builds weapons. Jokes aside, perhaps this is
related to the disagreement. Where I come from, "civil
engineer" means "advanced engineering degree", and
encompasses many disciplines, including architectural (for
lack of better word; I mean the American "civil engineer"
here), chemical, electrical, and yes, computer.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

narrative time line after the fact for the breakthroughs in
physics and engineering that eventually made the transistor
possible, this ignores the strong disagreements between
theoretical predictions and practical measurements of the
time. Regardless of their cause, it would be foolish to
assume that Shockley just sat down and applied some theory.
The theory just wasn't there yet.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

V, are sequential in nature. A player makes a move, then the next
player makes a move, and so on. The details can vary, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There could be two players, or multiple. This number is tightly
bound for scaling reasons, which we'll discuss later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game could have perfect information, like chess, where all
players see a move as soon as it is played. The game could also have
imperfect information, like Civilization V, where players see part
of a move, but the effets may be obscured by fog of war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The players may play in a consistent order (chess, Civilization V),
or in a somewhat random one (D&amp;amp;D's initiative system).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those things are more or less orthogonal to the turn system.
Players play turns sequentially, so I'm going to call these
&lt;em&gt;sequential turn-based games&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequential turns make scaling the number of players up difficult. Even
with only 8 players, any given player will spend most of their time
waiting. While 8 players are a lot for most turn-based games, it's
nothing compared to an MMORPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative to &lt;em&gt;sequential&lt;/em&gt; turn-based play is &lt;em&gt;simultaneous&lt;/em&gt;
turn-based play. In simultaneous turn-based play all players issue
their moves at the same time, and all moves are played out at the same
time. The simplest example is rock-paper-scissors, but Diplomacy works
the same way. More recently, this system has been explored by the
top-down tactical game &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.frozensynapse.com/"&gt;Frozen Synapse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While simultaneous turn-based play gets us closer to making massively
multiplayer turn-based games feasible by turning a linear scaling
problem into a constant time one, we're not quite out of the woods
yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider what happens when a player does not make a move. There are a
few reasons that might happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The player is not playing the game right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The player has stopped playing the game altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The player may be in a hopeless position, where stalling is better
than losing. (Stalling may tie up lots of enemy resources.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever gotten frustrated at a multiplayer game that has a
"ready" system before you begin a game, but had to wait because one of
the players disappeared; this is essentially the problem turn-based
games face &lt;em&gt;every turn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to mitigate this problem. Games can
duplicate playing fields. That works for both sequential games like
Hero Academy and simultaneous ones like Frozen Synapse. If a player
doesn't make a move, that particular instance of the game world
doesn't go anywhere; but you can play any number of games
simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this strategy to work, the playing fields have to be independent.
You don't lose heroes or soldiers because they're stuck on some stale
game. The worst possible outcome is that your game statistics don't
reflect reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That works, but rules out a permanent game world with shared
resources. If there's a larger story being told, you would want these
worlds to be linked somehow: be it through shared resources, or
because they're literally the same game world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a number of creative ways to get out from under that problem,
usually by involving wall-clock time. For example, if a player doesn't
respond within a fixed amount of time, they may forfeit their turn.
Fuel consumption might be based on wall-clock time, not turns. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.lvh.io/posts/on-multiplayer-turn-based-game-mechanics.html#f1" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;
There's a lot of degrees of freedom here. Do you use a global clock,
or one local to a particular area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A global clock is probably simpler, but poses some game play
challenges. How long is the tick? Too fast, and a player may see their
empire annihilated while they're sleeping. Too slow, and the most
trivial action takes forever. There isn't necessarily one right
answer, either. In an all-out cataclysmic struggle between two
superpowers, a complete tactical battle plan may take a long time. Any
timescale that isn't frustratingly short for that situation will be
frustratingly long for anyone trying to guide their spaceship (or
kodo, depending which universe you're in) across the Barrens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local clocks have their own share of difficulties. You still need to
answer what happens for anything that isn't in a particular battle;
you still need to answer what happens when battles merge or diverge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently exploring the shared global clock. In order to mitigate
the issues I described, I'm contemplating two ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow programmable units; a la Screeps, CodeWars...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow players to plan several turns ahead of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are, of course, not mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

wall" in a sense. If my engines are still consuming fuel real
time, why can't the enemy fire missiles? Either time is
stopped, or it isn't. Sure, games can be abstract, but that
feels like an undue inconsistency.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

hy·per·ca·thex·is, n, pl hy·per·ca·thex·es \-kə-ˈthek-səs, -ka-\:
excessive concentration of desire upon a particular object&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm considering renaming the project to its plural, hypercathexes,
because then it can be about a hyper cat in a bunch of hexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real constraints I started with was that I wanted a
simultaneous turn-based space game on a hex grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amit Patel from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redblobgames.com"&gt;Red Blob Games&lt;/a&gt; has basically the awesomest page
about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/"&gt;hex grids&lt;/a&gt;, and a ton of awesome pages about many other areas
of game development. I think it's a fantastic resource for programmers
like myself who don't do game dev as a day job, but just want to make
a little game on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous turn-based means that all players plan their moves
simultaneously, and they are then also executed simultaneously. This
has an interesting scaling effect. On the one hand, it clearly scales
better to many players, because players "play" simultaneously. On the
other hand, you start getting interesting problems. For example, clock
synchronization. Does the entire world advance with the same tick-tock
pattern? What happens when a player does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make a move within the
allotted time? If you allow different clocks in the world, does time
advance faster if both players submit a move, or do you always wait
until the maximum timeout?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted an excuse to play with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swannodette/om"&gt;Om&lt;/a&gt; and found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/plexus/chestnut"&gt;Chestnut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lvh/hypercathexis/tree/d454da2b1d8c1cf491fc3cd7dba83ee1b2bd4c76"&gt;first version&lt;/a&gt; had a working hex grid, but displayed it using
offset coordinates. I wanted to work using axial coordinates as much
as possible, because it makes a lot of math so much easier. Axial
coordinates work together with the "grain" of the hex map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;object data="http://www.lvh.io/img/AxialBaseVectors.svg" type="image/svg+xml"&gt;
axial base vectors&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second thing I did was move from individual &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags produced by
Om to a single &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; with hexes (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;polygon&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) inside it. This
fixed a number of annoying placement issues with CSS. CSS really wants
to position things based on bounding box, not midpoints. That's great
for web pages, not so much for my hex grid. I ran into a number of
annoying issues where certain hex borders would be wider than others.
Browsers aren't made to draw hex grids based on left/right offsets, I
guess...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by expressing distances in the SVG in terms of the hex
width, which would become my unit. The height would then be
\(\sqrt{3}/2\). Then, I realized that I could make my life easier by
expressing all x coordinates in terms of a single hex width, and all y
coordinates in terms of a single hex height; then I could just scale
differently across x and y at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Simple SVG hex grid" src="http://www.lvh.io/img/BasicSVGHexGrid.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing in Firefox was mostly painless, but I discovered many
discrepancies once trying it in Chrome. Things that should be the same
aren't, particularly when it comes to transforms. For example, Chrome
would occasionally literally do the inverse of the scaling it was
supposed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Differences in scaling behavior across browsers" src="http://www.lvh.io/img/HexGridCrossBrowserScalingIssues.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess trying to implement things in browsers was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>game</category><category>hex</category><category>hypercathexis</category><category>mathjax</category><category>svg</category><guid>http://www.lvh.io/posts/hypercathexis-dev-notes-part-1.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2014 13:55:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What the heck is a clojure.lang.IFn$LO?</title><link>http://www.lvh.io/posts/what-the-heck-is-a-clojurelangifnlo.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that I love Clojure. Like any tool though, it isn't
perfect. Today, I was trying to write unit tests that use
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;clojure.core.async/timeout&lt;/tt&gt;, so I wrote a test double analogous to
Twisted's &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Clock&lt;/tt&gt;. As I tried to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;with-redefs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; it in, I got the
most inscrutable error message out: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;java.lang.ClassCastException:
icecap.handlers.delay_test$fake_timeout$timeout__22934 cannot be cast
to clojure.lang.IFn$LO&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wha? I know &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;clojure.lang.IFn&lt;/tt&gt;, Clojure's function type, but what
the heck is a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;clojure.lang.IFn$LO&lt;/tt&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for the term didn't give any particularly useful results. It
was clear this happened when I was redeffing the original &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;timeout&lt;/tt&gt;,
so I looked at its documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
clojure.core.async/timeout
([msecs])
Returns a channel that will close after msecs
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't look too special to me. What's the type of that thing, anyway?
Let's find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;gt; (parents (type timeout))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$LO clojure.lang.AFunction}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha! So that is actually part of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;timeout&lt;/tt&gt;, not something else wonky
going on. What does the source say? It's a pretty lame shim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
(defn timeout
"Returns a channel that will close after msecs"
[^long msecs]
(timers/timeout msecs))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, nothing interesting there, just a type hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. Wait. That's not just a type hint. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; is a primitive.
Testing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;gt; (parents (type (fn [^long x] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$LO clojure.lang.AFunction}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha! Due to a JVM quirk, functions with a primitive type hint are
special. That works for doubles, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DO clojure.lang.AFunction}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And multiple arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x ^double y] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DDO clojure.lang.AFunction}
&amp;gt; (parents (type (fn [^double x ^long y] x)))
#{clojure.lang.IFn$DLO clojure.lang.AFunction}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a simple type hint to the function fixed it. Success!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>clojure</category><guid>http://www.lvh.io/posts/what-the-heck-is-a-clojurelangifnlo.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2014 13:15:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On discussing software security improvements</title><link>http://www.lvh.io/posts/on-discussing-software-security-improvements.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common criticism of information security folks is that they tend to
advise people to not do any crypto. Through projects like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.crypto101.io/"&gt;Crypto
101&lt;/a&gt;, I've attempted to make a small contribution towards fixing
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the open source world, various people often try to improve the
security of a project. Because designing secure systems is pretty
hard, they often produce flawed proposals. The aforemetioned tendency
for infosec-conscious people to tell them to stop doing crypto is
experienced as unwelcoming, even dismissive. Typically, the only thing
that's accomplished is that a lot of feelings get hurt; it seems to
only rarely result in improved software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's quite unfortunate. I think open source is great, and we
should be not just welcoming and inclusive, but aiming to produce
secure software. Furthermore, even if a flawed proposal is
unsalvageable, a clear description of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is flawed will
presumably result in fewer negative interactions. Best case scenario,
the issues with a proposal can be discussed and potentially rectified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to improve this situation, I'm documenting what I believe
to be a useful way to discuss security changes and their tradeoffs. As
Zooko has taught me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Security isn't about perfect versus imperfect or about better versus
worse, it's about &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; attack surface versus &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; attack
surface.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document aims to be the equivalent of an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sscce.org/"&gt;SSCCE&lt;/a&gt; for generic bug
reports: a blueprint for making suggestions likely to lead to
productive discourse, as long as we can agree that we're trying to
produce more secure software, as well as provide a welcoming
development environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="important-points"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good proposal should contain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief description of what you're suggesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A description of the attack model you're considering, why the
current system does not address this issue, and why the suggested
system &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; address this issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A motivation of the attack model. Why is it important that this
issue is actually addressed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this change affect the attack surface (i.e. all of the
ways an attacker can attempt to attack a system)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the user experience for all users of the system look
like? Many cryptosystems fall over because they're simply unusable
for most users of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="an-example"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wul (the widely underestimated language, pronounced &lt;em&gt;/wool/&lt;/em&gt;) is a
general purpose programming language. It has a package repository,
WuPI (the Wul package index, pronounced &lt;em&gt;/woopie/&lt;/em&gt;), the de facto
standard for distributing and installing Wul software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WuPI uses TLS as a secure transport. The WuF (Wul foundation,
pronounced &lt;em&gt;/woof/&lt;/em&gt;), maintains a root certificate, distributed with
Wul. Thanks to a well-managed system of intermediary CAs run by a
tireless army of volunteers, this means that both package authors and
consumers know they're talking to the real WuPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice is the WuPI BDFL. Bob is a Wul programmer, and would like to
improve the security of WuPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While consumers and authors know that they're talking to the real
WuPI, there is no protection against a malicious WuPI endpoint. (This
problem was recently made worse because WuPI introduced a CDN, greatly
increasing the number of people who could own a node.). You know that
you're talking to something with a WuF-signed certificate (presumably
WuPI, provided the WuF has done a good job managing that certificate),
but you have no idea if that thing is being honest about the packages
it serves you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob believes WuPI could solve this by using GPG signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He starts with a brief description of the suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I would like to suggest that WuPI grows support for GPG signatures
of packages. These signatures would be created when a package author
uploads a package. They would optionally be verified when the user
downloads a package.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues with the attack model being considered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe this would secure WuPI consumers against a malicious WuPI
endpoints. A malicious WuPI endpoint (assuming it acquires an
appropriate certificate) is currently free to deliver whatever
packages it wants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains why the current model doesn't address this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The current system assures authenticity and secrecy of the stream
(through TLS), and it ensures that the server authenticates itself
with a WuPI/WuF certificate. It does not ensure that the package is
what the author uploaded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains why he believes his model does address this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the signatures are produced by the author's GPG key, a
malicious WuPI endpoint would not be able to forge them. Therefore,
a consumer is sure that a package with a valid signature is indeed
from the author.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains why this attack model is important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
With the new CDN support, the number of people with access to such a
certificate has greatly increased. While I certainly trust all of
the volunteers involved, it would be nice if we didn't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to.
Furthermore, the software on the servers can always be vulnerable to
attack; as a high-value target, it certainly isn't inconceivable
that an attacker would use an unknown vulnerability to take over a
WuPI endpoint.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He (believes to) address the attack surface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the signatures are optional, the attack surface remains the
same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he addresses the user experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weak point of this scheme is most likely the user experience,
because users historically seem to dislike using GPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hopeful that this increased value of participating in the GPG
web of trust will mean that more people participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice reviews this, and notes a flaw in the proposal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This proposal aims to address a security flaw when the WuPI endpoint
is malicious by adding signatures. However, a malicious WuPI
endpoint can lie by omission, and claim a package was never signed
by the author.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob now realizes this issue, and suggests an improvement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This could be rectified if the user insists on a signature for
packages they expect to be signed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, Alice notes that the attack surface does increase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This places trust in author's ability to manage private keys, which
has historically been shown to be problematic. That introduces a new
attack vector: an attacker can attempt to go after the author's
private key.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the outcome of this conversation, there actually was a
conversation. I believe this to be an improvement over the overall
status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing personal. Octopress is fine software, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External packages, like themes, made my installation quickly
impossible to understand and manage. What's the difference between
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;javascripts&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;js&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;css&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;style&lt;/tt&gt;? I don't know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance. Nikola builds sites nearly instantly. Even with a
moderate amount of pages, I found Octopress too slow. Maybe I just
need a better laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python. While I'm sure the Ruby tools are of similar quality to
Python's; I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; Python's tools. Porting to Nikola was easier
than learning about A-grade Ruby developer installations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm on Nikola now. Pretty happy with it. I used
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.github.com/mikemccracken/nikola-octopress-import"&gt;nikola-octopress-import&lt;/a&gt;. Did most of what I wanted; I contributed
some minor PRs so that it would also handle extended date formats
(with seconds and timezones) and legacy HTML posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.lvh.io/posts/switched-to-nikola.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2014 06:46:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On TrueCrypt and full-disk encryption</title><link>http://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/05/on-truecrypt-and-full-disk-encryption.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early hours of May 29th (CEST), &lt;a href="https://www.truecrypt.org"&gt;the TrueCrypt website
(&lt;code&gt;https://www.truecrypt.org&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; has pointed
to &lt;code&gt;http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/&lt;/code&gt;, with an ominous-looking error
message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed
security issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page exists only to help migrate existing data encrypted by
TrueCrypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft
terminated support of Windows XP. Windows 8/7/Vista and later offer
integrated support for encrypted disks and virtual disk images. Such
integrated support is also available on other platforms (click here
for more information). You should migrate any data encrypted by
TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on
your platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website then explains how you can install BitLocker, a proprietary
disk encryption system available in many versions of Windows, as well
as how you could "rescue" existing TrueCrypt volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were pretty unhappy, for a variety of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of trust in proprietary full-disk encryption software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many versions of Windows didn't even ship with BitLocker, only a few
  "premium" versions did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a proprietary system, BitLocker is not susceptible to the same
amount of public scrutiny as a publicly available system. This is in
stark contrast with TrueCrypt, where Matt Green recently raised around
70k USD to perform an &lt;a href="http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/"&gt;audit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are variety of scenarios that could've caused the TrueCypt
website to suddenly sport that message. The live Internet audience has
speculated wildly. I'll share my thoughts on that near the end of this
post, but there are two points I'd like to make that I think are far
more important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider if full-disk encryption is really what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is, consider if it should be TrueCrypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Full-disk encryption&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I learned from the inimitable &lt;a href="https://zooko.com"&gt;Zooko&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security isn't about perfect versus imperfect or about better versus
worse, it's about &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; attack surface versus &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; attack
surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't just add more crypto junk to something and expect to somehow
get better security. You have to consider what it is buying you, and
what it's costing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-disk encryption buys you one simple thing: if someone steals your
device while the encrypted volume is locked, they probably can't read
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the encrypted volume is unlocked, it's over; and that's the state
it's probably usually in. If the key lives in RAM (it usually does),
there's a variety of ways that can be extracted. There's devices that
have complete direct memory access, including everything that speaks
FireWire or has FireWire-compatibility built-in. Even if you shut off
your machine, cold boot attacks mean that the key can be extracted for
a limited about of time. Various jurisdictions can try to force you to
hand over the keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an attacker can write to the (encrypted!) volume, it's probably
over. Virtually all sector-level full-disk encryption formats are
unauthenticated (with good reason), they're all malleable and
vulnerable to (adaptive) chosen-ciphertext attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're encrypting files or blobs of data within other files, an
authenticated encryption scheme like GPG is far more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong. Full-disk encryption is a good idea, and you
should do it. I'm just saying that what it actually protects against
is pretty limited. If there's files you want to keep secret, full-disk
encryption is probably not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details, try Thomas &amp;amp; Erin Ptacek's
&lt;a href="http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/04/30/you-dont-want-xts/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;
on why XTS isn't what you want. XTS is a way to build tweakable
ciphers that can be used to create full-disk encryption; but the post
applies to full-disk encryption generically as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TrueCrypt as a full-disk encryption mechanism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you probably want full-disk encryption, and you probably want to
make sure that sensitive data is encrypted on top of that. Great. What
full-disk encryption scheme do you use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to bash TrueCrypt. It is (was, perhaps?) a great go-to
project for full-disk encryption. It got a lot of things right. It
also got a bunch of things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TrueCrypt was made by a bunch of people we don't know occasionally
throwing a bunch of binaries over the wall. The source is available
(under a non-OSI license), so you could audit that and compile your
own binaries, but the truth is that the vast majority of TrueCrypt
users never actually did that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TrueCrypt disk format and encryption standards are a bit iffy. It
has terrible file system support. It has major performance issues,
partially due to questionable cryptographic practices such as cipher
cascades. It was great for when it was originally conceived and
full-disk encryption was still new and exciting, it's still pretty
decent now, but we can certainly do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What actually happened to the website?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't really know. There's a couple of guesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it looks like it are the original authors that folded:
the key is the same one that was being used to sign releases months
ago. Of course, that could mean that it was compromised or that they
were forced to hand it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the DNS records changed, the e-mail server behavior changed, the
same key was used, the Sourceforge client was involved, and fairly
major changes to the source code were involved, it's unlikely that
it's a simple defacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely that they folded because they felt discovery of some
backdoor was imminent. Folding wouldn't actually stop that discovery,
because the source was already open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's strange that they would point to alternatives like Bitlocker for
Windows and even more dubious alternatives for other operating
systems. The authors certainly knew that this would not be an
acceptable alternative for the vast majority of their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the support window for XP ending isn't a particularly
convincing impetus for migrating away from TrueCrypt &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. This
has lead some to believe that it's an automated release. Worse, it
could be a gagged response: a big and powerful three-letter agency
might be twisting their arm and forcing them to fold, in return for
something else (like, say, not being thrown in a Gitmo cell and
forgotten about). Again: pure speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is that some of the developers just really, genuinely
folded. They felt that for atechnical users, BitLocker was good
enough, while the particularly discerning TrueCrypt user would be able
to find some other alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is that none of this really matters. What matters is what
you should do next if you want to have full-disk encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So what do I do now?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think LUKS is probably the best system that we have right now, and
one of the few that actually improves on TrueCrypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're on Linux, dm-crypt + cryptsetup + LUKS is probably what you
want. If you're on OS X, FileVault 2 is probably what you want. If
you're on Windows, your options are looking a bit thin right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep using old versions of TrueCrypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give up and use BitLocker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a Linux virtual machine to use dm-crypt/LUKS, eventually
  migrating to native support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think the first option is the most reasonable right now,
and then wait until someone actually writes the native LUKS support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you should probably install GPG to encrypt some of those files
stored on that encrypted volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>crypto</category><guid>http://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/05/on-truecrypt-and-full-disk-encryption.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2014 17:53:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>More on financial aid grant optimization</title><link>http://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/04/more-on-financial-aid-grant-optimization.html</link><dc:creator>lvh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.lvh.io/blog/2014/03/10/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid/"&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about ways to optimize PyCon
financial aid grants. This is a follow-up on those efforts. Quick
recap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a fixed budget \(b\) available for grants, between 100k
  and 200k USD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a number of people (approximately 300) requesting various
  amounts \(r_i\) (approximately between 100 USD and 2000 USD) of
  financial aid, and receive a grant \(g_i\) so that \(0 \le g_i
  \le r_i\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial aid applicants can be assigned scores \(s_i\), a
  relative value describing how much we'd like to have them at PyCon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCon wants to optimize the total expected value of scores. That
  means getting as many people as possible to come, weighted by score.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've conjectured that we can estimate the probability \(p_i\)
  that someone attends as either \(g_i/r_i\), or \((g_i/r_i)^2\).
  The former prefers to spread the budget across a larger number of
  smaller grants, whereas the latter prefers to focus the budget into
  a smaller number of larger grants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of that doesn't make sense, you should read
&lt;a href="http://www.lvh.io/blog/2014/03/10/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid/"&gt;the previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we're trying to solve the optimization problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\max \sum E[S_i] = \sum s_i \cdot p_i$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most optimization texts appear to prefer minimization,
alternatively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\min - \sum s_i \cdot p_i$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject to a budget constraint and an individual grant constraint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\sum g_i \le b$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$0 \le g_i \le r_i$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater-than-zero constraint for individual grants is fairly
important, otherwise the algorithm might casually give you answers
like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;k = 1: [ 10.  20. -20.  30.  50.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That list in the middle are the per-person grants. Notice how the
algorithm feels that the third person really ought to pony up some
cash so that some of the other people can go to PyCon ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Squared problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.lvh.io/blog/2014/03/10/optimization-problems-and-pycon-financial-aid/"&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; I ran into issues using a very
generic constraint solver. I ended that post saying that I would try
to remeedy that by applying a more specific solver that takes
advantage of a particular structure of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set \(p_i = g_i/r_i\), this turns into a linear programming
problem, since \(r_i\) is a constant. When you set \(p_i =
\left(g_i/r_i\right)^2\), it turns into a quadratic programming
problem. Turns out there's two things I missed about the quadratic
problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resulting problem is not convex. That means it's (probably)
  difficult to solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The estimated probability that someone will attend falls off sharply
  as soon as they don't receive the full amount they requested. At 50%
  of the requested grant, the estimated probability of attending is
  only 25%; at 90%, it's 81%. This is the opposite of what we want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fixing the model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean we should put the \((g_i/r_i)^k\) out to pasture:
it just means that I didn't pick the \(k\) I really wanted.
Specifically, if I were to pick \(k=1/2\), I'd get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$p_i = \left(\frac{g_i}{r_i}\right)^{1/2} = \sqrt{\frac{g_i}{r_i}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if  \(k = 1/n\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$p_i = \left(\frac{g_i}{r_i}\right)^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{\frac{g_i}{r_i}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That problem &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; convex, but it isn't linear, quadratic, or some
other easy specific problem. It's just constrained multivariate convex
optimization. That's okay, there are still a couple of applicable
optimization algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these algorithms require the derivative of the goal function
with respect to a particular grant size \(g_j\) at a particular
point. In case we don't have the real derivative, we can still provide
a numerical approximation. In our case, we don't really need to
approximate, since the derivatives are fairly easy to compute
analytically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{\partial}{\partial g_j} \sum_i s_i \cdot
\sqrt[n]{\frac{g_i}{r_i}} = \frac{s_j \cdot {g_j}^{\frac{1}{n} -
1}}{\sqrt[n]{r_j} \cdot n}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding a solution with Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few Python packages that contain optimization algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SciPy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cvxopt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pyopt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone originally pointed me towards cvxopt. While I'm sure it's
excellent software, I already knew SciPy, so I went with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SciPy's optimization module provides the following algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fmin_l_bfgs_b&lt;/code&gt; - Zhu, Byrd, and Nocedal's constrained optimizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fmin_tnc&lt;/code&gt; - Truncated Newton code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fmin_cobyla&lt;/code&gt; - Constrained optimization by linear approximation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fmin_slsqp&lt;/code&gt; - Minimization using sequential least-squares programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nnls&lt;/code&gt; - Linear least-squares problem with non-negativity constraint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two are not applicable because they only appear to support
bounds on individual variables. I also need a constraint over the
&lt;em&gt;sum&lt;/em&gt; of variables for the budget:  \(\sum g_i \le b\). The last one
isn't applicable because this isn't a linear least-squares problem.
That leaves &lt;code&gt;cobyla&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;slsqp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Experimenting with linear approximation (COBYLA)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making COBYLA work ended up being pretty easy. The only non-trivial
part is expressing all your constraints as expressions greater than or
equal to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've uploaded my IPython notebook
(&lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/lvh/10107818"&gt;viewer&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/lvh/10107818"&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produced the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;scores: [1 1 1 2 3 5 5]
requested: [10 20 30 30 50 10 50] total: 200, budget: 150
k = 1/0.5: [ 10.  20.  30.  30.  50.  10.   0.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/1: [ 10.  -0.   0.  30.  50.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/2: [ 10.  10.   7.  27.  36.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/3: [ 10.  11.   9.  25.  35.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/5: [ 10.  11.  10.  24.  35.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/10: [ 10.  11.  11.  23.  35.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
k = 1/100: [ 10.  11.  11.  23.  34.  10.  50.], sum: 150.0
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As predicted, as \(1/k\) increases, the optimization gradually
  starts spreading the budget out more evenly; preferring to give many
  partial grants rather than a few large ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This effect is mostly only pronounced for \(1/k = 2, 3\); after
  that, increasing \(1/k\) doesn't make much of a difference
  anymore. This is what I'd expect when I visualize the \(p_i\)
  functions in my head, but I haven't ruled out numerical instability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even at high \(1/k\), the two high scorers get their full grant
  amount. That's quite understandable for the one that's only asking
  for 10, but even the one asking for a large grant gets it
  unconditionally. This probably means that tweaking the scoring
  functions is going to be very important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The linear version is apparently already quite brutal: the person
  with score 3 requesting 50 simply gets it entirely, leaving no
  budget left over for the people with score 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm so pleased with these results, I'm skipping &lt;code&gt;slsqp&lt;/code&gt; until I
feel like it. Next up, I'll try to compare the COBYLA results above
with the results of the greedy algorithm under various fitness
metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>mathjax</category><category>pycon</category><guid>http://www.lvh.io/posts/2014/04/more-on-financial-aid-grant-optimization.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2014 03:34:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
